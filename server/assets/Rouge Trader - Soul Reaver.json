THE \nSOUL REAVER  is a chance for daring Explorers to \nlook deep into the twisted heart of Dark Eldar society in the Koronus Expanse, and pull the greatest heist of their careers, ripping an alien ship from the very center of a Dark Eldar city hidden in the webway. T\nHE SOUL REAVER  also contains \na full Career Path for a Dark Eldar Kabalite Warrior, which players can use to create their own Dark Eldar characters for the Adventure contained in this book and beyond.\nWho Are The \nDark Eldar?\n“I am all your nightmares. I am the legends your forebears whispered of in fearful tones. Every terror you have never imagined comes from me. Look upon my majesty and weep at the terror I have wrought upon you and your kin. I am an artist, and dread is the colour I splash across the canvas of your mind.”\n –Archon Anas Vaenix of the Kabal of the Sundered Eye\nThe tale of the Dark Eldar is the tale of the decline of the Eldar race. For uncounted millennia, the Eldar dominated the galaxy, their might unchallenged by any other species. \nHowever, without anything to threaten them for so long, the Eldar turned their attentions inwards. With every passing generation, the taboos and restrictions of the past fell away in the wake of unconstrained exploration of lore and sensation, until no act was beyond comprehension. Over thousands of years, the potent psychic echoes of generations of depraved acts coalesced within the Warp, growing steadily more potent.\nEven amidst this, certain places were havens of debauchery \nwithin a civilisation that revelled in its own lust for experience. Foremost amongst these places was the city of Commorragh, which grew from a mere port within the webway to the centre of the hedonistic culture that had come to dominate Eldar society. Cults of Sensation thrived within the labyrinthine realm of the webway, hidden from prying eyes and the lingering, puritanical elements of Eldar society.\nAs the psychic mass of coalesced decadence gathered, horriﬁc \nWarp storms wracked the galaxy. Preferring to use the webway, the Eldar scarcely noticed the oncoming storm. Those few who did perceive the danger ﬂed the homeworlds to try to escape the unknowable doom that was to come. Most, however, remained willfully oblivious to this burgeoning terror, the slumbering god created in the image of the darkest part of the Eldar psyche. The cataclysm that followed was the awakening of that god, \na moment when the collective debauchery of the Eldar race \nemerged as an entity in its own right, and devoured its \ncreators with its ﬁrst breath.In a matter of moments, the psychic vortex annihilated \nvast majority of the Eldar species, wrenching their souls from their bodies and subjecting them to an eternity of torments in the maw of a newly-born Chaos god. The few who remained, scattered across the galaxy, were the last survivors of a species on the verge of extinction, and would forever face the inescapable peril of She Who Thirsts, the Ruinous Power known as Slaanesh and the doom of all Eldar.\nTHE DARK CITY\nThe isolated nature of the alternate dimension within which Commorragh and the thousands of other settlements in the webway existed spared those Eldar living there from the instant demise that grasped so many of their kin. Instead, they faced a different peril altogether—She Who Thirsts \nwould eternally draw upon their souls, leeching them away \nslowly. Whereas other Eldar have found ways to deny She Who Thirsts her desires, those who dwell within the Dark \nCity of Commorragh were required to ﬁnd some other way to \ncounteract the endless curse of the god they birthed.\nThese Eldar of the webway found that the suffering of \nothers could nourish their hollow spirits, renewing their \nwithered souls with the pain and terror of others. Provided they surrounded themselves with the most vile and decadent acts, these Eldar could abate the curse of Slaanesh, keeping them vital and strong and eluding the passage of time. So it was that the Dark Eldar were born, a race of sadistic murderers who feed upon the anguish of others in order to prevent the slow"

For the ten millennia since the \nFall of the Eldar, the malicious denizens of Commorragh have raided and plundered their way across the galaxy, terrorising and enslaving those they regard as lesser creatures.\nIndividual Dark Eldar are cruel, ﬁercely intelligent \ncreatures, their bodies and minds honed by long lives of survival in the cutthroat environment of the Dark City. The \nleast of them are vicious beings, desperate for even the tiniest \nmotes of suffering to slake their desperate and unnatural thirsts. The greatest, the warrior castes who embark upon raids into realspace and make up the dominant members of the Kabals and Wych Cults, are tall and lithe killers, with athletic physiques and lightning-fast reﬂexes. They grace the spires of the Dark City and battleﬁelds across the galaxy with the conﬁdent poise of predatory gods, their majesty concealing the rotted, hollow desolation of their souls. To those able to perceive the Warp, they appear vile and ghoulish, more closely resembling what they truly are: horriﬁc beings that hunger for the torment of others.\nOver the millennia, Dark Eldar society has become stratiﬁed \nand divided, fragmenting into cults, sects, and factions, warring for prestige, power, and the slaves whose suffering is the lifeblood of the Dark City. The mightiest of these are the Kabals, grand institutions forged in bloodshed and savage \npolitics, dominated by Archons—masters of political intrigue \nand personal combat alike, deadly foes both within the courts of High Commorragh and upon the battleﬁeld. No less necessary to Dark Eldar society are the Wych Cults, whose members are gladiators extraordinaire, masters of the savage spectacle, creatures both beautiful and deadly and adored by the common populace for their bloodthirsty performances. The Covens of the Haemonculi are ancient and terrible circles of depraved geniuses, masters of impossible sciences and keepers of the secrets of immortality.\nBeneath these are numerous smaller groups, lower in prestige \nbut no less signiﬁcant. Reckless gangs of Hellions haunt the skies between the spires, descending to murder and torment any that catch their attention. Enigmatic, deadly Incubi sell their lethal craft to the highest bidder. Winged Scourges ﬂit from their barbed eyries and soar amongst the courts of the Kabals, serving as messengers for the paranoid Archons. In the depths, savage Mandrakes skulk between the shadows, rending the ﬂesh of the unwary with ice-cold talons.\nThe majority of Dark Eldar are born artiﬁcially, grown \nrapidly in vitae wombs and amniotic tubes. Only those with power and wealth have the luxury of raising children naturally, and these Trueborn are raised to rule, taught from a young age the secrets of vicious courtly intrigue, and truly believe themselves to be superior to all those half-born around them. These mighty few are beyond even death, for the wealth and infamy of those who rule in the shadows allows them to secure the services of the Haemonculi, \nwhose vile sciences allow them to resurrect the dead \nfrom scraps of ﬂesh and the agony of the tortured."

Today, these tunnels are twisted, stretched, and torn by the psychic pressure of the Warp storms dividing the Calixis Sector and Koronus Expanse. While the mysterious rites of the Harlequins long ago sealed many of these passages, others still remain open to the tides of the Warp, infested with \nvile and ephemeral creatures. \nThis region of damaged tunnels is centred across the Warp \nstorm known as the Screaming Vortex. The Vortex is home \nto teeming hordes of daemon-worshippers and mutants, living and dying at the whims of warlords and sorcerers \nintent on murder and subjugation in the name of their dark \ngods. While this a ready source of slaves and victims for the raids of the region’s Kabals, it is a realm largely inhospitable to the Dark Eldar, so strong is the presence of She Who Thirsts within the storm. However, suspended at some point between the Screaming Vortex, the Koronus Expanse, and the webway is an island of relative stability where numerous groups of Dark Eldar have formed a twisted haven. Here ﬂoats the Nexus of Shadows, a Dark Eldar outpost built upon an ancient and massive technological relic.\nThree major Kabals dwell in the tunnels and passageways \nthat cross the Calixis Sector, the Koronus Expanse, and into the Screaming Vortex. The foremost of these, at the heart of the Nexus, is the Kabal of the Splintered Talon. The others, the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns and the Kabal of the \nCrimson Woe, are of a more mercenary inclination due to \ntheir lesser status, often selling their murderous skills to other races in exchange for resources or opportunities to grasp at power. The Kabal of the Crimson Woe operates in the Calixis Sector more than in the Koronus Expanse, in part to avoid directly competing with the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns and thus drawing their ire. Numerous other groups exist alongside these, from the Cult of the Withered Blade, which controls the Bloodspine Pits on the Nexus of Shadows, and The Sutured Helix, a coven of Haemonculi that operates from the Nexus of Shadows, to numerous smaller factions that raid and scavenge for scraps of the might and prestige.\nThe Dark Eldar operating near the Nexus of Shadows are \nfrequently on the move, either carried within ﬂeets of ships or travelling in smaller groups on light skimmers through the winding and impossible labyrinth of the webway, returning to \nthe Nexus of Shadows only periodically to trade their cargo \nof tormented victims for supplies and to replace slain warriors. These itinerant raiders often cross paths with pirates and reavers of other species, particularly the Chaos-aligned ﬂotillas that hail from the Screaming Vortex and isolated bases like Iniquity. A select few of these have been shown the location of the Nexus, so that they may trade in slaves, dark lore, and abhorrent technologies, but these are relatively rare."

Whatever happens, should the shadow of their ships darken your path, pray you die ﬁghting at the helm of your vessel, lest ‘fortune’ favours you and they take you alive…”\n–Magos Domos Agnelain, Explorator\nThe Dark Eldar are a plague upon the Koronus Expanse; raiders, slavers, pirates, and even Rogue Traders suffer at their barbed lashes and blades. Any who cross the \nMaw and sail the void of the Koronus Expanse learn to fear the wicked silhouettes of their ships and their seemingly endless cruelty towards all life, including their own. Only vigilance and ﬁrepower keep the worst depredations of these terrible raiders at bay, though from the dens of Footfall to the commerce halls of Port Wander there are countless tales of crew lost and ships savaged in their sudden attacks. Within the Calixis Sector, \nthe Imperial Navy keeps the Warp routes and sector worlds \nprotected against the worst of these raids, and while some outposts and lone vessels still disappear at the hands of the foul xenos, most citizens sleep soundly, never even knowing that such a depraved species haunts the stars above their heads. \nIn the Koronus Expanse it is different, as that lawless place \nhas neither a ﬂeet capable of guarding the uncharted wastes nor a tightly controlled network of worlds that can call upon one another in times of need. The Expanse is a playground for the Dark Eldar, where along with the myriad of other alien menaces they can raid worlds and take ships with relative impunity, slipping away into the night from whence they came. The power of the Dark Eldar is compounded by the fact that no one knows precisely where they come from or where they go, nor can they explain the aliens’ uncanny ability to appear from nowhere and then vanish with \ntheir stolen cargos of goods and slaves just as quickly. Some Rogue \nTraders believe there must be a Dark Eldar world somewhere in \nthe Expanse from which they launch their raids, though where \nexactly it is and how it could have evaded detection for so long \nremain a mystery that has yet to be unravelled.\nGAME MASTER’S BRIEFING\nTHE SOUL REAVER  is an adventure in three parts that focuses on \nthe Dark Eldar of the Expanse and the power struggles between its leaders. It takes the Explorers on a Grand Endeavour into the heart of a Dark Eldar city deep within the webway, where they must undertake a daring heist to steal an artefact of immense and ancient power, elevating their allies and casting down their enemies in the process. It brings the Explorers into direct contact with the Dark Eldar and their twisted ways, exposing them to both the risks and the proﬁts of making pacts and deals with such dangerous xenos. It also gives them a chance to gain a stake \nin the Dark Eldar’s vast trade networks (dealing largely in slaves) \nthat extend throughout the Koronus Expanse, the Calixis Sector, and far beyond, promising huge amounts of proﬁt for those without the burden of strict morals. However, it is no easy task to complete such an Endeavour, and as the Explorers discover, Dark Eldar are just as treacherous allies as they are enemies.This adventure takes place in the Koronus Expanse and the \nruins of the Eldar webway. The core setting for the adventure is the \nDark Eldar city known as the Nexus of Shadows, which sits atop \na vast artiﬁcial planetoid trapped in the webway and has become a centre for trade between dozens of xenos races and the Dark Eldar themselves. Because the adventure takes place largely in the Nexus of Shadows, the GM can set it almost anywhere and is not restricted to the Koronus Expanse. If he so chooses, he can have his players enter the webway from another point or discover a way to the Nexus from another part of the sector or segmentum, or even elsewhere in the galaxy. T\nHE SOUL REA VER  presents the Nexus \nof Shadows as a complete setting, which allows the GM to use it beyond the remit of this adventure, especially should the Explorers succeed, and they can return again to its shadowed streets and dark spires to trade and have their dealings with the Dark Eldar.\nThe three sections of this adventure form a Grand Endeavour \nthat provides the GM with a framework to gauge the progress and success of the Explorers as they delve into the Nexus of Shadows and tackle the plots and schemes of the Dark Eldar. This Endeavour can be modiﬁed to suit the GM’s needs, and \nbroken down into smaller sections or padded out with new goals \ndepending on the actions of the Explorers. A detailed breakdown of the Grand Endeavour’s objectives can be found at the end of each chapter of the Adventure.\nGM G UIDANCE\nThroughout this adventure there are numerous GM Guidance sidebars offering the GM advice and further details on how to run an encounter or respond to the actions of the Player Characters. These sidebars may give suggestions and solutions to the outcome of an encounter or an insight into the design behind an event that should aid the GM in running the adventure. The GM Guidance sidebars also offer details on scaling the power level of the adventure to the GM’s group of Explorers. Given the open nature of the adventure and the huge number of possible outcomes and confrontations, there \nis no set or predetermined Rank or Proﬁt Factor requirements \nfor T\nHE SOUL REAVER . Instead the GM can adjust the difﬁculty \nof encounters to match the abilities of the Player Characters.\nADVENTURE  OVERVIEW\nTHE SOUL REAVER  takes place over three distinct chapters, \neach one following on from the events in the preceding \nsection. The adventure begins when the Explorers meet Salaine Morn, Archon of the Shadowed Thorns and an exile from Commorragh and now the Nexus of Shadows in the wake of treachery of a former comrade. Forming an alliance with her, the Explorers must then inﬁltrate the Dark Eldar city and steal the core of its power, an ancient alien ship known as The  Soul Reaver. Unfortunately, Salaine’s plan is \nﬂawed in a way even her devious alien mind cannot predict, \nand her miscalculation costs the Explorers their freedom, as \nthey are captured and dragged into the Shadowspine Pits to serve as slave gladiators. In the second chapter, the Explorers must rally the slaves of the pit to their cause and start a full-blown uprising to escape. Finally, in the third chapter, the Explorers must make their way across the war-torn Nexus of Shadows to"

It is not easy to secure such an alliance, but there are numerous ways in which the Explorers can meet the Dark Eldar, and for the two parties to ﬁnd a \nshared motive strong enough to work together. Once the \nExplorers secure a deal, they join Salaine’s renegade ﬂeet and take their place in her plot to capture the Nexus of Shadows for herself. The heart of this plan involves the Explorers and \nSalaine inﬁltrating the city and stealing The Soul Reaver from \nthe palace of her arch-rival Zaergarn Kul, leader of the Kabal \nof the Splintered Talon and ruler of the Nexus of Shadows. An ancient alien ship fuelled by the power of death itself, The Soul Reaver is the cornerstone of Zaergarn’s power and \nwithout it the city’s defences will fail, allowing a full-scale invasion from Salaine and her renegade ﬂeet.\nThe Explorers must use either their cunning, stealth, \nor might to make their way to the Archon’s palace, likely becoming embroiled in the plots and schemes of the city’s many factions along the way. Once they reach the Archon’s \npalace and sneak or force their way inside, they must then \nbegin the process of preparing The Soul Reaver for transit, \nsetting charges to blast it free of its moorings so their own \nship might latch onto it and rip it free of the palace, dragging \nit out of the webway and back into realspace. However, things do not go as the PCs predict. Drecarus, a Haemonculus nominally in the employ of Zaergarn who has been ruling his empire from the shadows since the real Archon’s demise, is prepared for their inﬁltration. As they reach their goal, Drecarus intervenes, leading to imprisonment and slavery for the Explorers and a major setback to Salaine’s plans.\nChapter II: Blood, Steel, and Sand \nThe second part of the adventure follows the Explorers’ trials as slave gladiators of the Withered Blade Wych Cult, the second most powerful faction in the Nexus, and close allies of the Splintered Talon. Even as slaves, the PCs still have a chance to see Salaine’s plans through and complete their lofty goal of conquering the Nexus of Shadows. As gladiators, they need to work their way towards freedom by earning favour and prestige within the dark society surrounding the cult and win battles in the arena so that they can engineer an escape. The slave pits are also a place to make new allies: humans and \naliens captured by the Dark Eldar and forced to ﬁght in their \nendless, sadistic games. Along with these allies, the Explorers must make plans to win their liberty, gathering the resources and support they need. However, what begins as a simple \nbid for freedom by the PCs quickly escalates into a full-scale \nuprising, and with the aid of the Explorers, the gladiators \nand slaves of the Nexus cast off their bonds and turn \non their wicked masters.Chapter III: Maelstrom of Souls\nThe third part of the adventure begins as the ﬁres of uprising set the Nexus of Shadows ablaze. During this chaos, the Explorers resume their mission to steal The Soul Reaver, and thus \nallow Salaine’s renegade ﬂeet to invade the Nexus of Shadows. The Explorers are not the only ones who take advantage of the \ncarnage caused by the uprising, however, and other factions \nwithin the city may well rise to the opportunity to seize power or settle old scores. Though all this madness, the PCs must make their way to the Archon’s palace and ﬁnish what they started. \nTearing The Soul Reaver free has unforeseen consequences, as its \ndark energies awaken and the dead Archon leads the countless \nlegions of screaming souls trapped within The  Soul Reaver on a \nrampage against everyone who has wronged him and anyone unfortunate enough to be nearby. Ultimately, the Explorers must vanquish the echo of Archon Zaergarn Kul and The Soul \nReaver  before it can burn the Nexus of Shadows to ash—and \ntheir chance at promised proﬁts along with it!\nOnce the dust settles, if the Explorers have succeeded, The Soul \nReaver  lies dormant once again and the faction they have chosen \nto back (be that Salaine Morn, the slaves, or even themselves) \nhas won total mastery of the Nexus of Shadows. The Explorers \nreceive a healthy reward for their efforts, as well as a chance to \ntap into the proﬁts of the city and its thriving trade networks. \nWhether or not the Grand Endeavour proves proﬁtable for \nthe Explorers, they must perform great deeds to survive this adventure, and tales of their insane ambition echo between the stars of the Koronus Expanse.\nGM G UIDANCE : D ARK ELDAR  PC S\nTHE SOUL REAVER  introduces the option for players to \nplay Dark Eldar Kabalite Warrior characters in their games of R\nOGUE TRADER .

In the years since Salaine Morn discovered its location hidden within the webway and then, in alliance with \nArchon Zaergarn Kul, seized and settled it, the city has festered \nand grown into a common port for the Dark Eldar and those who trade with them. As a base, it provides an excellent and well-hidden locale to raid the nearby Koronus Expanse, Calixis Sector, and even the Screaming Vortex, while its place within the webway gives it access to hundreds more worlds scattered across the Segmentum Obscurus and beyond. Even slavers from the Dark City of Commorragh buy and sell their wares at the Nexus or pass the time watching the blood sports of its arenas. It has earned a reputation among the Dark Eldar as a city rich with slaves from the weakly defended worlds of nearby Imperial Sectors and the numerous scattered human worlds of the Expanse cut off for so many years from the safety and protection of the Imperial battleﬂeets. For many Imperial citizens taken from these sectors bordering the Halo Stars, the Nexus is a ﬁnal, terrible \ndestination, where they will end their lives as slaves working in \nits bone-pits or spilling blood in its arenas.\nWhile Rogue Traders who listen carefully can hear rumours \nof the existence of the Nexus of Shadows at many ports across the Koronus Expanse and even in some places within the Calixis Sector, its actual location is a closely guarded secret. Even those xenos that trade with the Dark Eldar must be guided to its location by the city’s scouts through the shattered and perilous twists and turns of the webway. Few aliens understand the webway, and the Craftworld Eldar are loath to utilise more than a fraction of the decayed and fractured network around the Calixis Sector and Koronus Expanse. The Dark Eldar, especially those outcast from Commorragh, are more adventurous and willing to risk ships and slaves to ﬁnd ways through its shadowed links and dark corners, but even they must tread with care, and only a handful have the skill to routinely reach destinations \nlike the Nexus of Shadows. The Nexus is in a particularly \nunstable portion of the webway, prone to Warp intrusions and reality collapses, and those Dark Eldar in good standing in Commorragh largely avoid it. This very danger makes the Nexus an ideal destination for the outcast, however, and exiles from Commorragh such as the Kabal of the Shadowed \nThorns ﬁnd it an excellent based of operations. After all, \nwhat is the risk of reality itself falling to pieces at a moment’s notice compared to the agony that the great Archons of Commorragh promise to those who have offended them?\nQuite apart from its secrecy and the difﬁculty required \nto reach its gates, the Nexus is heavily defended against attack from orbit. Even if a ﬂeet reached the Nexus, it would ﬁnd itself facing a complex network of defence towers and shadow ﬁelds with the ability to utterly disorient attacking vessels and scour the sky clear of enemies in a blaze of light and ordnance. For centuries, this network has defended the Nexus and repelled would-be invasions from other Dark Eldar Kabals and xenos raiders alike. Control of the network remains the mark of the master of the Nexus, and the faction that holds the keys to its activation controls every vessel that wishes to land—or to leave.\nCombined, these factors have kept the Nexus of Shadows \nhidden for centuries on the doorstep of the Imperium; a shadowed secret from which the Dark Eldar might plunder the worlds of man for their own dark pleasure."

The size of a small moon, covered with towers and antennae, the sphere was crafted around a solid core, the remnants of some mineral rich asteroid that its automated systems are slowly eroding away as it adds more and more levels to the sphere. Neither the Gaelan Sphere’s alien inhabitants nor those few explorers from the Imperium who have had a chance to study it know its true purpose. Some speculate it was crafted for the purpose of lengthy study of a system \nor sector, its primary goal the gathering of information \nover thousands of years. The little knowledge that anyone \nhas uncovered about the sphere’s largely self-sustaining systems and repair functions and the numerous sensors and communication arrays dotting its surface suggest that this \ntheory has some merit. There are also those amongst the \nAdeptus Mechanicus who claim to have found a record of the Gaelan Sphere in an ancient binaric pictogram encoded in a damaged cogitator on the Lathe Worlds, and debates between techno-lexographers rage over whether this record suggests that it is of human origin, describes a date when the sphere was merely encountered by the Adeptus Mechanicus in the past, or is a blemish on the cogitator’s most august memory caused by a coolant spill in M.38.\nHow the sphere came to enter the webway is also a \nmystery. Abandoned for untold ages, the sphere could have drifted through a web-gate or even been drawn towards one by the ancient programs and protocols of its cogitators \nseeking to study a breach in the webway that it perceived \nas a celestial phenomenon. Alternatively, it is possible that \nsome unknown force moved it into the webway for some \ninscrutable purpose. Once it entered the webway, the sphere spent aeons drifting from one region to another before becoming trapped in a conﬂuence of ancient forces and alien powerﬁelds. Now, it ﬂoats in a relatively stable position, more debris of a forgotten age of enlightenment.\nDISCOVERY  BY THE KABAL   \nOF THE SHADOWED  THORNS\nIt was Salaine Morn and her Kabal that ﬁrst rediscovered the Gaelan Sphere and decided to put it to use. After being exiled from Commorragh, the Archon spent years wandering the webway with her ﬂeet, raiding worlds and looking for a place to claim as her own. The sphere, with its well-hidden location and ancient technology, presented the perfect place for a new home. Unfortunately for Salaine, the sphere’s defences and legions of servitor guardians were too numerous and powerful for her Kabal alone to overcome. Thus, Salaine forged an alliance with Zaergarn Kul and his Kabal of the Splintered Talon, and together they purged the city of its ancient human \ndefences, destroying that which they could not control and \nsealing away the areas that they could not inhabit.\nEven though their forces had secured a landing \nzone and deactivated the aging orbital defences, it \nwas to take years for the Dark Eldar to carve out \nthe areas where they would build their city. \nAs more Dark Eldar came to the Nexus, new sections would be cleared of their ancient automated \ndefences. Often the Dark Eldar would drive thousands of \nslaves into an area to identify these dangers, or simply to exhaust a turret’s ammunition so it could be destroyed. \nOther xenos races were also allowed to settle in the Nexus \nas part of trading missions, though these aliens had to clear their own areas for inhabitation. The lasting result of this wanton conquest by the Dark Eldar and their allies is that many areas of the Nexus still show signs of battle, and the stripped remains of the combat machinery of the sphere is a common sight along its shadowed streets. Occasionally, the Nexus’ old defenders rear their heads once again, but the Dark Eldar usually put them down swiftly.\nA C ENTRE  FOR SLAVERY\nAlmost immediately after the arrival of the Dark Eldar and its establishment as a port, the Nexus began to operate as a hub for trade and a base for raiding. Close to the Koronus Expanse and the Calixis Sector, it opened up fresh opportunities for slavers and worlds that before had been out of reach or too \ndangerous to raid using the fractured remains of the webway. \nThe Nexus of Shadows quickly grew in size and wealth on the backs of its slaves, despite the fact that most Dark Eldar of Commorragh at least openly shun the cursed place and the outcasts who live there. The xenos of the Koronus Expanse and the renegades of the Screaming Vortex have no such compunctions, however, and have found the Nexus to be a useful place to trade and congregate, a place far from the reach of the Imperium and utterly hostile to its agents. Salaine welcomed such factions into her city on account of the wealth and inﬂuence they offered, as well as the added protection it afforded her against those who would try and take the city from her. Unfortunately for Salaine, it was not an outside force or an alien that was to oust her from power. In the end one of her own, Zaergarn Kul, usurped her, and exiled her \nonce more into the webway before she could do the same to \nhim. For many of the inhabitants of the Nexus this change \nin power meant little, especially for the slaves, to whom one \nDark Eldar Archon is much the same as another."

The inﬂuence \nof the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns, Salaine’s Kabal, also \nlingers in the city, and the mercurial loyalties of many Dark \nEldar who inhabit the city could easily shift to back Salaine’s \nfaction again if her return to power seemed imminent.\nKABAL  OF THE SPLINTERED  TALON\n“Treachery is the birthright of our people, and the nature of our existence. Our grasp upon the things we desire, then, must be so tight that our nails split and our very talons bleed.”\n–Zaergarn Kul, Archon of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon\nZaergarn Kul was a favoured son of Commorragh for many long centuries, but eventually the wheel of fortune inevitably turned against him and he angered a number of more powerful factions within the Dark City. He led his Kabal into exile instead of seeing it destroyed, and immediately began seeking a new refuge from which he could consolidate his power. To this end, he sought Salaine Morn, whose Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns had recently uncovered the Gaelan Sphere, and offered her much-needed strength of arms to help claim it. When Zaergarn joined with Salaine, he brought with him a substantial number of warriors and slaves, and a raiding ﬂeet of numerous vessels easily the equal of what Salaine already possessed. Soon after, Zaergarn even enticed a Haemonculus named Drecarus and his coven, The Sutured Helix, to settle in the Nexus of Shadows \nand provide their unique services to the Kabals. Together, these \nforces were more than sufﬁcient to carve out a portion of the Gaelan Sphere for their new home.\nSince then the Splintered Talon has only increased in \nstrength, especially in the aftermath of Salaine’s expulsion and the destruction of much of her Kabal, when Zaergarn’s forces took complete control of the Nexus. The Splintered Talon absorbed many of the warriors and slaves of the Shadowed Thorns, and many of Salaine’s allies and contacts beyond the Nexus found new partnership with Zaergarn. As a result, this Kabal represents the single largest force within the Nexus and effectively controls its streets and the skies above its twisted towers. Practically every Dark Eldar the \nExplorers encounter within the Nexus are part of the Kabal, \nor closely allied with it, and present only at its pleasure. Zaergarn’s absolute orders are handed down to his Kabal from within his ziggurat, though he has not been seen by \nany outside of his fortress since Salaine sent an assassin to \nstrike him down during their ﬁrst conﬂict over the Nexus. \nStill, there are numerous lords and captains who act in his \nname in the Shadowed Arteries, the Bonespires, and other \nparts of the Nexus. Drecarus in particular is the face of the Kabal, and when important business needs to be dealt with, it is this Haemonculus who usually appears.\nThe warriors of the Splintered Talon are distinct from the \nother denizens of the Nexus in their blood-hued armour and their use of specially modiﬁed and bladed splinter weapons. Where they travel, locals and visitors alike take heed and stay out of their way, lest they suffer the xenos’ cruelty. All members of the Splintered Talon, and even those slaves bound to their service, know it is their Archon who rules the Nexus, and treat all others accordingly. Anyone the Explorers \nencounter outside the Kabal will warn them that it is never a \nwise idea to challenge the warriors of the Splintered Talon, \nsince there is no one brave or foolish enough to stop them \nfrom doing as they please. Still, despite their dominance over the Nexus of Shadows, the Kabal of the Splintered Talon can hardly be bothered to police every part of the city, and rarely deign to set foot below the surface of the sphere or at the outskirts of the settlement.\nCULT OF THE W ITHERED  BLADE\n“I have been on a quest for perfection since before you existed, and the quest will go on long after you expire. The only question is, will your death be another step on the road to the consummate kill?”\n–Anyalra, Succubus of the Cult of the Withered Blade\nStanding in the shadow of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon is the Cult of the Withered Blade and its Succubus, Anyalra. This Wych Cult forms the backbone of the slave trade, and has seen \nits rise and prosperity since being brought into alliance with \nSalaine and Zaergarn in the early years of their settlement on the Nexus. Though less numerous and inﬂuential than the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, the Cult of the Withered Blade is no less vital to the running of the city, and it is the games of the Shadowspine Pits, along with the beasts and slaves that they keep, that draw much of the trade that keeps the Nexus alive and keep the wicked"

Unlike \nZaergarn and his Kabal, the Cult of the Withered Blade does not overly concern itself with what occurs outside the walls of its arenas, and is interested only in traders and the acquisition and preparation of slaves for combat. Part of this is offering the \nsadistic entertainment that the Dark Eldar ﬁnd so vital to their \nexistence, and which other inhabitants of the Expanse are also \ndrawn to out of morbid curiosity. Anyalra has no true appetite for the politics that drove a wedge between Zaergarn and Salaine (though at the time she did ﬁnd herself caught up between \nthe two warring Archons), and is now more than content that \nZaergarn chooses not to leave the ziggurat and that the Kabal of the Splintered Talon takes no active role in her affairs.\nWhat does interest the Salaine and her Cult of the Withered \nBlade is the blood sport that the Cult hosts within the Shadowspine Pits, and the acquisition of suitable slaves and beasts for these games. The Cult is more than happy to trade with the Explorers if they can offer such ﬁghting stock, and invites them to witness their goods in action if the Explorers engage in business with the Cult. However, Anyalra is generally unreceptive to the idea of Salaine returning, or any ambitions to depose the Zaergarn, simply because it would be a change in the status quo. As with many Dark Eldar leaders, Anyalra prefers to wait and see who is near to triumph before casting her lot with anyone hoping to command the Nexus, and does not make a play herself as long as \nher slave trade and precious games are left undisturbed.\nKABAL  OF THE SHADOWED  THORNS\n“Plan for a century if you must, but strike in the blink of an eye. Once \nyou move, you can never stop until you reap your victory. Or you die.”\n–Salaine Morn, Archon of the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns\nZaergarn took most of the Dark Eldar of the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns and added them to his own forces after Salaine’s defeat and her escape into the void. However, there still a few lurking within the city who have the remnants of allegiance to the Shadowed Thorns and would still hold fealty to Salaine should she return. Whether or not these elements \ncome into play during the course of the adventure is up to the \nGM, and he can use these lingering sentiments of loyalty, in \nboth Dark Eldar or the other inhabitants of the Nexus, to \naid the Explorers if they are in need, or if they seek \nthem out for help. Such loyalists will usually be \nindividuals, some in the service of the Splintered \nTalon, keeping quiet and hiding their true feelings about the rule of the nexus. Such individuals will also \nbe unlikely to go out of their way or put their lives at risk (they would not have survived this long with such noble ideals, which are anathema to the treacherous Dark Eldar anyway) but could provide information or subtle assistance (such as opening portals within the ziggurat or sneaking the Explorers weapons if they are captured) if offered the right incentives.\nLESSER FACTIONS\nThe Nexus is also home to a smattering of aliens and humans, all with their own agendas and reasons for seeking a dark corner of the galaxy. The GM can use any or all of these factions to aid or hinder the Explorers’ ambitions in the Nexus. To make this task easier for the GM, each faction has \na section detailing its goals and how they might interact with \nthe Explorers both as allies and as enemies.\nGM can also include other groups in the politics and \ntrade of the Nexus, as it is possible that almost any race \nwith a stake in the Koronus Expanse might also have a \nhand in the Dark Eldar city. This could include more trade-\nfocused factions like the human reavers or slavers, or even agents of heretical tech-cults, risen from the Screaming Vortex to study the Gaelan Sphere and harness its power.\nCULT OF THE FALSE  DAWN\nThe proximity of the Screaming Vortex and its tainted worlds means that the Nexus is host to followers of the Dark Gods, come from the depths of that cursed place looking for slaves or wealth, or keeping alliance with the Dark Eldar for more nefarious purposes. The Kabal of the Splintered Talon has no particular love or hatred for the denizens of the Vortex, and allows them to enter the city if they are willing to trade and \ndo not undermine its power. It does nothing to regulate their \nbehavior so long as they do not make war on the Kabal, and \nso there are more than a few dark corners of the Shadow \nArteries where the walls are daubed with obscene symbols \nand Chaos cults have taken root.\nAmong these renegades are the followers of the False \nDawn, a ragtag Chaos cult led by a disposed Scintillan noble named Henaris Tinis, drawn to the Nexus by stories of The \nSoul Reaver. Henaris believes that The Soul Reaver contains \nspirits trapped in its crystalline hull, and wants to sacriﬁce them as morsels to the Dark Lord of Pleasure. His cult has grown since arriving in the Nexus, at ﬁrst only comprising of a number of ragged exiled Calixian nobles and their servants. Over the years, its numbers have swelled in small but steady increments as wanderers and heretics, some of them from the worlds of the Vortex, others ﬂeeing persecution in the Imperium, have found a haven in the Nexus. Even so Henaris \nlacks the strength to reach The  Soul Reaver, let alone destroy \nit in the ritual that he believes will send its ethereal prisoners \ninto the Warp and the waiting arms of Slaanesh. Thus far, his grand plan has remained purely conceptual, in part because his cult is fractious and divided in its loyalties to the Ruinous Ones and in part because, for all his heretical dabbling, he lacks any true sorcerous power."

      "text": "13\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nWhen the Explorers arrive he sees them as a gift from the \nKeeper of Secrets and a path to his goal and the glory of his \ngod, making efforts to harness their power and ally himself with them. Even if he does not learn of their intent right away, he is interested in their status as Rogue Traders and any ties they \nmight have to the Calixis Sector. Explorers with any kind of lore \nrelating to Scintillan or Calixian nobility will probably recognises \nthe name of the House of Tinis, and might know more about Henaris and the reason for his exile than he would like.\nGoals: The Cult of the False Dawn wants to sacriﬁce the \nspirits in The  Soul Reaver to Slaanesh, to earn favour and bring \nthe gaze of their god upon them. To do this, they need to loot the vessel of the crystals and stones containing its many spirits and then destroy them in an intricate ritual. The Cult of the False Dawn is also particularly interested in Neija Tromejien, and Henaris believes her to be just the mystic lynchpin he needs to perform the ritual, though she is largely uninterested in his schemes and does not share his loyalty to the Ruinous Powers.\nAs Allies: Henaris is no great warrior, only a thin, ageing \nman with the bearing and dilapidated ﬁnery to prove his noble heritage but few of the resources his family once possessed. His cult is hardly a military organisation, and contains sundry unpleasant individuals who have rejected Imperial society to live on the outskirts of the Nexus of Shadows where they can freely worship their dark gods. Henaris’ greatest asset to the \nPCs is that he has lived in the Nexus for years and knows many \nof its secrets. Winning Henaris’ support requires at the very least passing a Challenging (+0) Charm Test, though Explorers \nopenly afﬁliated with the Imperium suffer a –30 penalty to this Test and Explorers openly devoted to Chaos receive a +30 Bonus to the Test. Henaris offers his support no matter the results of the Charm Test (or their other social interactions with him), but if he is not convinced of the Explorers’ piety to the Ruinous Ones, he plans his betrayal from the start.\nAs Enemies: This cult is driven to recover The Soul Reaver, \nand though Henaris wants the glory for his cult alone, he might be driven to call upon aid from the Vortex and other followers of the dark gods if it looks like his prize is slipping through his ﬁngers. This can bring some very nasty individuals and creatures to the Nexus, which will cause problems for both the Explorers and Henaris himself if he is brought face \nto face with a true champion of Chaos.\nAssets: Henaris has roughly 20 ragged cultists at his beck \nand call, plus another 200 who nominally pledge fealty to \nhim but will only obey so long as it is convenient and in their own interests as well. These forces are scattered throughout the Nexus of Shadows, mostly occupying the Shadowed Arteries, and hear a great deal that might otherwise be ignored or forgotten. He can gather this rabble into a small army over several days, although few are trained soldiers. Henaris and his followers uses the statistics for Renegades from page 373 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook, \nthough Henaris receives a +10 bonus to his Fellowship and Intelligence Characteristics and training in the Common Lore (Dark Eldar), Common Lore (The Nexus of Shadows), and Speak Language (Dark Eldar) Skills.SONS OF COMMORRAGH\nWhile the Kabal of the Splintered Talon is the dominant \npower in the Nexus, covert trade with Commorragh and other Dark Eldar settlements means that many agents of Kabals and Cults from beyond pass through the Nexus of Shadows. Most of these are minor servants of Archons with no personal power of their own. Some, though, are nobles who like to do their business themselves, or pirates who have no ﬁxed bases and moor their ships at the Nexus to refuel and reﬁt. These Dark Eldar are free agents within the web of xenos politics, who may aid or hinder the Explorers depending on their own petty goals and ambitions.\nThe GM can use these aliens as a lesser faction in their own \nright and a source of NPCs to inﬂuence the actions of the PCs allies and the other Dark Eldar within the city, and also to reinforce the notion that the Dark Eldar do not represent a single uniﬁed race with a single leader or motivation. Among \nthese xenos can be nobles who still favour Salaine, or who \nZaergarn had wronged in the past and might be willing to offer some small aid to the Explorers to see him removed from power. Equally, some might be interested purely in proﬁt, appearing as a dark reﬂection of the Explorers’ own ambitions—captains and pirates with no masters or oaths but those they make aboard their ships.\nCONSORVANA  RING\nThe trade in alien artefacts and forbidden tech is a very proﬁtable one, and there are numerous individuals and organisations within the Expanse that ferry these items into the Imperium, usually via the Calixis Sector. In the Nexus, these powers are collectively known as the Consorvana Ring, as they are led by a woman named Sirissa Consorvana, an ex-Imperial Navy master of ordinance and a veteran pirate. In conjunction with \ncontacts in Footfall, Sirissa has been living in the Nexus of \nShadows for several months, after following the slave trail to \nits location and realising the wealth in alien technology and \nancient artefacts that it offers. In this short time, she organised \nthe various scavengers and other traders into a loose alliance and began the shipping of goods back to Footfall while also eliminating several Cold Traders peddling goods from the Nexus who have refused to join her “association of friends.”\nAlthough Sirissa has been able to strip out technology from \nthe sphere and trade with the Dark Eldar, she has yet to make a really big score, and has been looking for something to make the hardships of living in the Nexus worthwhile. Recently she learned about The Soul Reaver and the stories of its power, though \nshe does not know it is a ship, only that it is hidden somewhere in the ziggurat. She has set her sights on stealing The Soul Reaver \nas an end game to her time in the Nexus, once she has plundered what wealth she can from the ruins of the sphere and its Dark Eldar inhabitants. With such an artefact, she believes she could \nset herself up for life, buying a moon or a ship for herself, and \nhas no interest in the item itself, only the coin it offers.\nThe arrival of the Explorers prompt her to advance her \nplans if she learns they are also after The Soul Reaver. Out of \nall the denizens of the Nexus, she is the most likely to recognise the Explorers if they have visited Footfall"

Even if she does not know them, it is likely, given her long list of contacts, that they share friends (or enemies).\nGoals: The Consorvana Ring is after wealth, plain and simple, \nand Sirissa wants the payday that The Soul Reaver can bring. If \nthings go badly and she is unable to take sole control of the alien vessel, she will settle for a piece of the reward for taking The Soul Reaver . Sirissa also wishes to help liberate her colleague in the \nCold Trade, Anja Shen, from the Shadowspine Pits to clear an old debt she owes Captain Shen. Of course, she would prefer to \ndo this without angering the Dark Eldar of the Nexus (at least \nuntil such time as she decides to make her ﬁnal departure from the Nexus with as much of their treasure as her ships can carry).\nAs Allies: Sirissa only has limited information on the Nexus \nto offer the PCs, given her short time living there. However, her resources are quite considerable given her connections to the Koronus Expanse, and she can offer much in the way of outside support. As an ally, she can get things for the PCs from beyond the Nexus or help them to move about the city undetected aboard the transports and ships of the Consorvana Ring Agents—for a price, of course. Sirissa offers information freely enough, but winning her support enough for her to commit real resources requires passing a Difﬁcult (–10) \nCharm Test. If the Explorers fail this Test (or their other social interactions with her), Sirissa offers her support anyway, but \nmerely sees the Explorers as another set of marks to trade with \nand then rob at her convenience.\nAs Enemies: The Consorvana Ring values the chance to \nmake proﬁt above all else, and if it looks like they can make more thrones turning the Explorers in or betraying them, then this is the course they will take. They are averse to excessive risk, however, and usually retreat in the face of substantial force.\nAssets: Sirissa uses the proﬁle for a Void Pirate Captain \nfrom page 373 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook. At \nher disposal, she has two Sword-class Frigates and a single Jericho-class Pilgrim Vessel (proﬁles for these vessels can be found on 194-195 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook). \nShe also has two squads of ﬁve Oathsworn Bodyguards who protect her person and carry out her tasks across the Nexus of Shadows (the Oathsworn Bodyguard proﬁle is on page 372 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook).\nTHE REAVERS’ MOON\nThe Nexus of Shadows is a completely fabricated planetoid, its surface a complex web of structures, towers, and supports reaching down to a core of churning machines and grinding engines. Designed by forgotten architects, its once ordered surface and chambers, purposeful towers and sensor farms, and its symbiotic collection of manufacturing facilities have fallen into decay and disarray over the long ages it spent ﬂoating alone in the void. In this time, it has strayed from its ancient \npurpose, whole sections of the artiﬁcial world going dark and \nfalling into ruin or becoming twisted and warped by machines \ngone mad or the ﬂawed programs of cogitators that \nendlessly fabricate and assemble unnecessary sections \nwith no purpose but to add to the maze of chambers \nand towers already cluttering up their sectors. On \ntop of the sphere’s own damaged systems and the cancer of time that steadily eats away at its structures and \nsystems, it has sustained damage during its long and lonely voyage through the void. Impacts from asteroids and debris have punched holes in its surface or toppled its towers, radiation and celestial energies have scoured areas clean of life making them deadly to any who stray into them, and in some areas the sphere has picked up alien passengers, creatures that arrived on \nﬂoating debris or drifting hulks and have since multiplied and \nﬂourished in the dark corners of the sphere.\nThe greatest change to the Gaelan Sphere has been, of course, \nthe arrival of the Dark Eldar. Before these sadistic xenos arrived to make the moon their own, it was little more than a ghost ship \nof ponderous size, adrift in the void and haunted by mindless \nbeasts and half-mad machines. It was Salaine and her Dark Eldar who saw the potential of the cursed world, and so they overcame its initial defences, carved out a place for themselves in the most intact region of the sphere, and thus created what was to become the Nexus of Shadows. They then took over the numerous towers and other structures, adding to them and building their own until they had planted the ﬁrst seeds of a city. From there, they moved outwards and downwards through the disused and empty spaces of the sphere, driving the aimless machines and alien predators before them. Where they encountered strong resistance or came into contact with a zone toxic to life or too heavily defended by automated defences, they turned in another \ndirection. After all, the sphere contained thousands upon \nthousands of kilometres of chambers, corridors, and levels to \nexplore and claim, and there was no need to expend unnecessary \nresources on overcoming a particular area or zone. The result of \nyears of this expansion has been a strange meshing of the Dark Eldar city into the ruins of the Gaelan Sphere. The Dark Eldar twist many existing structures and systems for their own ends while completely ignoring others, leaving many untouched and abandoned even in the heart of their settlements. The arrival of other alien races further expanded the borders of the Nexus, and these new species and factions claimed their own areas amongst the ruins, frequently far from the Dark Eldar city, in remote regions that provide better protection and, above all, privacy. Even with the decades of expansion and settlement by the Dark Eldar, the majority of the sphere remains unexplored and ignored, especially the lower levels, where the ancient machines still hold sway and only the foolish delve too deep.\nZAERGARN □S ZIGGURAT\nThe grandest and most powerful fortress in the Nexus of Shadows is the palace of the Archon Zaergarn Kul, chosen by Salaine and Zaergarn when they ﬁrst claimed the sphere and still the most impressive structure in the Nexus. This is the centre of power for the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and the heart of Dark Eldar rule on the Nexus. It is heavily guarded and fearsome to behold, its dark towers jutting up above the city, festooned with curved, bladed buttresses and crowned with jagged spikes. Only the most favoured of the city’s inhabitants are invited into the palace, and only the most fortunate are \ngiven the chance to leave again. Most who live in the shadow \nof the Archon’s palace need not concern themselves with direct dealings with the rulers of the Nexus, making their trades with lesser Dark Eldar or other xenos, and staying clear of the lethal machinations of Dark Eldar politics."

Though he rules beside the Cult of the Withered Blade and relies upon them for their slaves and the games they oversee, he commands the true military power within the Nexus. Zaergarn Kul also holds the key that powers the Razor’s Web, the Nexus’ potent orbital defence network of armed towers and deadly arrays, giving him complete control over all shipping in and out of the Nexus. The ziggurat is also the Splintered Talon’s primary garrison and armoury in the \nNexus, and thousands of Kabalite Warriors ﬁll its lower levels \nalong with the scores of jetbikes and Raiders that can sail forth and crush any resistance within the city at a moment’s notice. Those who enter the ziggurat must pass through the garrison to reach the inner chambers if they wish an audience with ruler of the Kabal. This is a carefully rehearsed routine Zaergarn planned long ago, so that any who deal with him have to ﬁrst see up close the extent of his military might and the number of troops and machines he can unleash should he so choose. \nThe ziggurat towers over the Nexus, and can be seen from \nalmost any point in the Dark Eldar holdings on the sphere, a grim reminder of the gaze of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and its power over everyone who dwells in his shadow. Zaergarn chose it for both for its size and the defences it already had in place. Shaped like a broad, blunt tooth and \nnow festooned in Dark Eldar spires that completely obscure \nits original form, the ziggurat is one of three vast command \nbridges those who originally created the Gaelan Sphere \nbuilt to house its ofﬁcers and captains and guide the sphere \nthrough space in the same manner as a ship. In this way it shares many of the characteristics of the bridge of a voidship, only on a much larger scale. When Salaine ﬁrst encountered the sphere, she noted the three ziggurats as likely places to settle her Kabal and create a centre for her new city. However, upon closer inspection when she returned with Zaergarn to found a Dark Eldar settlement, she noted that of the three, one was mostly destroyed and had collapsed internally into the depths of the sphere, while another was too close to an irradiated zone to make a good location for a city. This more than any other factor determined the location of the Nexus of Shadows on the Gaelan Sphere.\nOriginally both Salaine and Zaergarn shared the ziggurat \nbetween their Kabals. In the early days of the Nexus, there \nwas enough space for both forces to comfortably spread \nout throughout the structure without needing to cross \npaths too often for comfort. As the city grew with the Dark Eldar’s inﬂuence over the sphere, the control of the ziggurat became more of a problem, especially in those regions with functioning links to the sphere’s defence network. At ﬁrst both Archons expanded their zones, building towers and extending chambers, turning the ziggurat into a nightmare of twisting corridors and towers linked by spidery catwalks. Eventually tensions and shadowy politics and tactics turned into open conﬂict, and Zaergarn forced Salaine and her Shadowed Thorns from both the ziggurat and the Nexus.\nWhen Zaergarn took over the ziggurat, he expanded and \nmoved into those areas the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns once controlled. Now, years later, his Kabal has cemented its power and control of the structure, turning it into the most defensible part of the Nexus, almost impregnable to any form of external attack. The outer layers of the ziggurat, as well as its lower levels, form the Splintered Talon’s garrison and are a vast collection of training pits, living quarters, slave pens, and weapon stores. Tightly controlled and well-patrolled, intruders and interlopers are generally attacked on sight. Even slaves who become lost trying to complete their master’s wishes are shot should they encounter a patrol, as the Dark Eldar do not wait for an explanation and are usually happy for some target practise. In these areas, Drecarus has also reactivated and augmented \nmany of the sphere’s original defences, especially in the lower \nlevels where the Kabal’s minions do not deign to spend too much time. These range from turrets to caches of creatures modiﬁed by Drecarus’ mad art to cover many blind spots in the ziggurat’s defence. Even without defences and patrols, the outer skin and lower levels of the ziggurat are a confusing maze to those not familiar with their layout. In addition to the new corridors and chambers added by the Dark Eldar, many others have been sealed up or were destroyed during the initial ﬁghting to take the structure and have never been repaired. The only sure way to ﬁnd a way to the inner chambers is to follow a patrol or somehow tap into the ziggurat’s ancient control systems, which still slumbers in some of its damaged consoles.\nThe upper levels of the ziggurat were once a collection of \nsensor arrays and vox towers that guided the sphere though the \nvoid. Since the arrival of the Dark Eldar, most of these towers \nand viewing domes have been turned into mansions for the \nArchon’s favoured nobles or garrisons for his airborne troops. \nThe Dark Eldar have built their own signature spires, as well"

The towers are also where the ziggurat’s defences are strongest. In addition to the sky-borne troops that garrison them, there are dozens of turrets and gun-\ndomes armed with weapons capable of hitting ships in orbit. For \nthe Dark Eldar, the towers and their mansions are a playground \nwhere the Kabal of the Splintered Talon entertains important visitors and holds special private games high above the city. The largest central tower is also home to the Deathworld Gardens, a \ncollection of some of the most dangerous and aggressive plants \nfrom a dozen worlds all carefully selected to create a beautifully fatal arboretum and tended to by Drecarus and others from his Coven. From gantries above the gardens, guests of the Kabal watch the fearsome ﬂora in action as they devour, poison, or dissolve terriﬁed slaves set loose in the elegant hellscape. Other towers house countless other grim collections, including both an extensive menagerie and grotesquery gathered over many years of raiding and experimentation by Drecarus.\nThe deep chambers beneath the ziggurat are the most \ndifﬁcult to access and are protected with numerous checkpoints and defence layers The Sutured Helix installed. There are few slaves in these chambers except those of the Haemonculi’s making, and those unfortunates sent to serve there inevitably end up on the Haemonculi’s experimentation tables. Zaergarn’s \ninner chambers sit in the heart of the ziggurat, several \nkilometres above the shadowy domain that the Kabal of the Splintered Talon cedes to The Sutured Helix. The Soul Reaver, \nthe greatest prize of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and the key to their dominance over the Nexus of Shadows, also rests here. Long ago, Zaergarn tore a hole in the ziggurat and built around the ship, sealing it into the city and hiding it away. It was The Soul Reaver that gave Zaergarn the edge to defeat \nSalaine (see A Mournful Tale on page 31) and it provides the \nziggurat with the power it needs to run its extensive network \nof defences. The Soul Reaver powers the Razor’s Web, without \nwhich the Nexus would be largely defenceless. Almost seven \nkilometres in length and several kilometres across, The Soul \nReaver  takes up a large portion of the inner chambers, the \ncorridors connecting to the ship and its prow forming the foundation of Zaergarn’s central tower that reaches up above all the others. The transition from the ziggurat into the vessel is distinct and unmistakable. Cold, grey plasteel walls with blunt pressure doors and heavy bulkheads covered with Dark Eldar accoutrements and spires give way to blackened, rotting arches, ﬂuted supports pock-marked by twisted carvings, and jewelled ﬁxtures that pulse with a sickening glow, marking the shift from one nightmare domain into another.\nIt is here in the heart of this alien ship that Zaergarn is said \nto reside, where the sound of whispers permeates the air and a strange sense of disquiet lies heavy on the ground. Only the most favoured of his followers may set foot upon The \nSoul Reaver, and Drecarus’ loyal Wracks guard every entrance, standing vigil with orders to kill any who might disturb the \nArchon. As a result, there are few who know what the interior \nof the ship holds, and fewer still who have seen more than a fraction of its chambers and rooms. Those who dwell in the ziggurat’s inner chambers do, however, know that there is a power in the ship that any who must live near it can feel. It is even whispered that the ancient vessel somehow it has a hold on the Archon himself.\nTHE SOUL REAVER\nDiscovered in forgotten depths beyond the Halo Stars, The Soul Reaver is a vessel of alien design and ancient, \neldritch power. Zaergarn ﬁrst came upon the ship when he was seeking allies to use against Salaine. The Archon had dealings with all manner of aliens and creatures of the void, trading everything from slaves to secrets to look for an edge to use against his rival or a weakness to exploit. One such deal was with a Stryxis trader who offered him the location \nof an alien vessel discovered far beyond the Halo Stars. The \nStryxis described how the ship was somehow possessed \nand housed a great an angry spirit that the Archon could \nuse against his enemies, though the he claimed own crew had been too afraid to try salvaging the ship for themselves. Upon hearing the tale, Zaergarn suspected what this lost ship might be and sent out vessels to recover it. When they returned with the ship, his suspicions were conﬁrmed as he stepped on board and inspected the ship’s graceful design and the thousands of faintly glowing stones that studded its interior. The ship was too badly damaged to traverse the void effectively, corrupted and diseased from untold ages aﬂoat in the darkness, but for the Archon’s own purposes it was perfect. With the aid of his Haemonculus Drecarus, Zaergarn was able to harness the energy within the ship and turn it to his own ends, naming it The Soul Reaver in honour \nof its dark new power over the energies of death."

It \nis also a great store of spiritual force, and its thousands of strange, glowing stones can be tapped for power to fuel Dark Eldar technology, especially in the webway where such \nenergies ﬂow more freely. During his struggle with Salaine, \nZaergarn used The Soul Reaver to fuel the ziggurat’s defences \nand the Razor’s Web, giving him the edge he needed to defeat \nher even after she had disabled the generators that normally granted the Razor’s Web its killing power. Afterwards, he \nintegrated the damaged vessel into his palace and linked \nits power to the rest of the city, giving him unprecedented control. The Kabal of the Splintered Talon uses the twisted the crystal and bone structure of The Soul Reaver as \na conduit for spiritual energy that gains power from every death that occurs in the Nexus, giving the ruling Kabal a near limitless supply of power and an iron grip upon everything that transpires in his city.\nTHE SHADOWSPINE  PITS\nBeyond the great ziggurat from which the Kabal of the Splintered Talon rules the Nexus, the towers and great shadowed metal canyons of the Dark Eldar city sprawl out in all directions. Among them is the second largest cluster of structures inhabited by the xenos: the Shadowspine Fighting Pits. This is the domain of the \nCult of the Withered Blade and the \ncentre for their cruel games and the \nthriving slave trade that keeps the \nNexus alive. The Withered Blade has reshaped the pits set around the sphere’s gravity-maw into a series of descending levels, dropping deep into the heart of the artiﬁcial moon. On each level they host games, house slaves, and train gladiators. Some levels are also given over to wild beasts and the breeding of monsters. These areas are separated from the rest of the pit by vast ancient blast doors and bulkheads, though accessible should the Withered Blade choose to release the monsters within. The Dark Eldar have incorporated many of the old mechanisms of the gravity-maw into their ﬁghting pits, allowing them expand or \ncombine their arenas with the pull of a lever or open gateways \ndeep into the burning heart of the sphere to drop slaves and beasts screaming to their deaths.\nThe gravity-maw was originally constructed so that the \nGaelan Sphere might devour asteroids to feed its deep furnaces and turn them into raw materials. Several kilometres across, it is a vast opening in the side of the sphere, surrounded by a wall of suspensor arrays and mag-grapnel towers which the Dark Eldar have largely converted into living quarters or places from which to view the games. Given that the asteroids that the sphere once consumed would vary dramatically in size from only a few hundred metres across to more than a kilometre or two in diameter, the gravity-maw is not constructed as a single gate covering the tunnel into the sphere’s interior. Instead it consists of dozens of gates, each able to open independently, with even more gates at lower levels all the way down into the heart of the Gaelan Sphere. The gates are all set into the superstructure of the sphere with steep sloped sides (often surrounded with teeth to catch \ndebris) making each gate a natural pit and perfect for arena \ncombat. The Cult of the Withered Blade makes extensive use of these gates and levels to create dozens of a arenas, including a single central arena (known as the Bloodgate) that can be \nopened, closed, and otherwise manipulated at will.\nThe ancient systems that allowed the sphere to \ntrap and devour asteroids and other huge space \ndebris are still largely intact, and over the \nyears the Withered Blade has learn to use \nthese systems to control the gravity within the arena. This allows them to move objects from lower levels to upper levels without \nthe need to transfer them through internal \ncorridors and chambers. This function has \nproven especially useful for the transportation of wild beasts, \nallowing the Dark Eldar to \nliterally levitate them into the \nmidst of gladiatorial combats. \nIt also allows the Withered \nBlade to stage unique matches \nwhere gravity is either increased \nor decreased. This can mean \nﬁghters struggling around the \narena as the weight of their bodies increases to the breaking point or allowing them to leap \nacross its surface in long, slow \narcs as they hack at each other \nmidair In some of the “events,” \nslaves are simply hurled into the \narena to be battered by rapidly \nchanging gravity conditions, ﬂying \nabout and crashing into each other and \nanything else the Dark Eldar choose to throw \ninto the maelstrom of bodies and debris. Bets are \nthen placed on which slave will live the longest or \nwhether a vicious beast can catch a preset number \nof slaves as it ﬂails about in near weightlessness, trying \nto close with its equally disoriented prey.\nAs with the Archon’s ziggurat, the spires surrounding the \ngravity-maw and the levels beneath its many gates are ﬁlled with Dark Eldar warriors. In this case, it is the Wyches and beasts of the Withered Blade that ﬁll its halls, training and patrolling their domain.

Anyalra oversees \nmuch of this, and certain levels and gates are reserved for the trading of slaves, with places for buyers to spectate as the Dark Eldar display their wares and take them through their paces. The most dangerous of the slaves or beasts are kept to \nthe lower levels to keep them away from the Dark Eldar and \nthe business of the arena until they are ready. Being held in \nthe lower gates also means that should Anyalra decide a slave \nor beast is too much trouble, she can always open the gate and drop it into the blazing heart of the sphere.\nTHE BONESPIRES\nThe Dark Eldar city has spread across a signiﬁcant portion of the sphere and the aliens have turned the designers’ original works to their own advantage. Among these modiﬁcations are the Bonespires, so named by the Dark Eldar on account of their broken and ruined appearance, like the rotted bones of a beast poking up through a carcass of desiccated ﬂesh and decaying skin. Once part of the huge array of sensor towers, vox relays, and pict arrays that allowed the Gaelan Sphere to study the void around it, the Bonespires are now the domain of the most powerful and prosperous of the Dark Eldar. Those that have not \nyet earned the honour of joining the Archon in his ziggurat must \nmake do with residing high above the shadow streets of Nexus \nin gardens and manors purpose-built to suit their own dark \ndesigns. Like the towers above the ziggurat, the Bonespires have a dark and hateful appearance, covered in bladed balconies and twisted spikes and needles jutting from their black plasteel stems. Bridges like strands of glittering razor wire reach out between the Bonespires, linking them together, and some towers rise up in tight knit clusters; these are the domains of powerful lords and traders, cut off from the rest of the city below.\nMany important visitors to the Nexus never see more than \nthe tower gardens of a given lord, making their contracts and securing their goods without ever descending into its depths or setting foot in the Archon’s ziggurat. The Bonespires are not without their dangers, and though the lords of the towers might not play for the fate of the Nexus itself, they can be just as vicious as any Archon when it comes to trade or control of the best spires. Given that the effort to clear out \nand reﬁt a tower is extensive and costly, many lords prefer to \ntake towers from their rivals to expand their holdings. For the most part, there is little open war between lords, as the Kabal of the Splintered Talon is quick to respond to anything that would cause too much disruption to his city, but any and all other means are accepted. Thus, a lord may spend years undermining a rival with assassination, trade disruption, and sabotage before he is in a position to subjugate his foes without excessive overt violence or damage to the Nexus. \nSPIRES  OF DEATH\nWhen Salaine and Zaergarn ﬁrst created the Nexus of Shadows, they had to overcome the Gaelan Sphere’s automated defences. A squad of Salaine’s specialist warriors his was achieved this through destroying the power relay stations that supplied the energy to the network and creating an undefended area around the ziggurat and the future site of the Dark Eldar city. After the city had been established and the ziggurat’s system \ncorrupted, the Dark Eldar repaired the power relay and used \nthe network to defend the city. Over decades the network was then augmented, and many of its damaged or depleted armaments were replaced with Dark Eldar technology. While Salaine and Zaergarn ruled together, they shared joint control of the defences, and their tenuous alliance required them to only be able to activate the power relay together. When conﬂict between the Archons ﬁnally came into the open, Salaine took no chances—her elite lieutenants once again disabled the generators, and thus she considered herself safe from the defences and brought her ﬂeet in close to the city to provide support. Unknown to her, Zaergarn had already acquired a new source of power for the defences: The Soul \nReaver . The result was the destruction of much of Salaine’s \nﬂeet and the ascendance of Zaergarn to power.\nThe Kabal of the Splintered Talon still uses The Soul Reaver \nto power the network, known as the Razor’s Web due to \nits lacerating effect on vessels caught within it, and he has \ncomplete control over its activation and direction. The actual turrets, batteries, and launchers of the Razor’s Web are spread"

To date, the Splintered Talon has used the Razor’s Web only a handful of times, and usually only as an object lesson or to create a more favourable deal by making a show of power, but its threat remains very real and \nhas kept all but the most foolhardy of raiders at bay.\nSHADOW  ARTERIES\nHidden in the shadow of the Bonespires and far beneath the lofty \nheights of the Archon’s ziggurat are the debris-choked streets of Nexus. Known as the Shadow Arteries, they are the secret paths in and out of Nexus, where aliens and humans alike can exist away from the constant gaze of the Dark Eldar or the machinations \nof their lords and nobles. However, it is a mistake to think that \nthe Arteries are less important to the life of the city than the \nBonespires or arenas, and as the name suggests a great deal of \nvital information and goods ﬂow into and out of the city through them. It is also the perfect environment for visitors to conduct \nbusiness without interference from the Dark Eldar or from other \noutside agencies; few places are further from the eyes of the Imperium than the ruined streets of a city controlled by a hostile xenos race and hidden in a fold in space. As a result, aliens brush shoulders with worshippers of the Dark Gods, and exiles, men and women who can ﬁnd no other safe harbour or are wanted for unspeakable crimes, wander free. Here the worst of vices and pastimes can go unnoticed. The Shadow Arteries are completely lawless, the rulers of the Nexus caring little about what transpires there as long as it does not damage their trade or cost them too many of their troops. Those who walk the Arteries do so at their own risk and accept they might not walk out again.\nPhysically, the Shadow Arteries are just below the surface \nof the Gaelan Sphere, in the uppermost chambers and ﬁlled with atmosphere either by the wheezing bellows of the sphere, salvaged components from voidships, or xenos machines of bizarre and arcane manufacture. There is no starlight in these places of shadow, the passages lit only by the occasional lumen pad of the sphere or the guttering ﬁres of those who dwell there. When the Dark Eldar founded the Nexus, they settled the towers and upper levels of the sphere, ignoring the lower levels and the “streets” between the raised structures—areas where chambers sunk deep into the hull of the sphere or had little or no presence above ground. In time, as more races and inhabitants arrived in the Nexus, these areas were taken over and a clear divide was created between those in the towers (which became known as the Bonespires) and those below. This was the birth of the Shadow Arteries and became the ﬁrst port of call for anyone reaching the Nexus who did not have the favour of a Dark Eldar lord or noble and could \nland on a tower rather than the sphere’s surface. \nIn the decades since their ﬁrst habitation, the Arteries have spread out below the city, its areas seized and controlled by different factions, and crude borders established. Much of the place has also been cannibalised for scrap, and along \nwith the already ruined state of the Arteries, this means that \nin the areas beyond those controlled by a faction or powerful individual, the tunnels are ﬁlled with debris and rubbish or \noverrun by vermin brought to the Nexus in the holds of cargo \nships. These areas are also ﬁlled with thieves and brigands, the \ncast-offs of the Nexus who survive on the waste thrown down \nfrom above and on those travellers foolish enough to stray into their nests or too close to their hunting grounds. Below the Shadow Arteries, the sphere’s corridors are a true wilderness, ﬁlled with all manner of horrors as one passes beyond the smoky haze of the Arteries.\nOUTLANDS  AND BONEYARDS\nThe majority of the surface of the Gaelan Sphere and the vast artiﬁcial caverns below remain outside the control of the Dark Eldar. These dark zones stretch out from the alien city on all sides for hundreds of kilometres and comprise vast areas where no living soul has wandered for thousands of years. While some visitors to the sphere have led expeditions into these ancient wilds, the Dark Eldar have largely ignored them, expanding out from the edges of their domain as needed and focusing on the protection and trade of their city. As a result, what lies out in these dark regions is unknown, though it can be surmised that there are areas where the ancient systems of the sphere still hold sway and their archaic machines continue to clank \nand grind away at their endless tasks. It is also likely that solar \ndamage, strong radiation, or virulent toxins have rendered some \nzones completely impassable to any living thing. Likewise, \nsome areas have become overrun with parasites, collected by \nthe sphere during its millennia of drifting through the void and can be just as deadly to casual trespassers as an area bathed in poisonous vapours or corrosive lakes.\nThe result is a dark wilderness in which the Nexus stands \nout as a guttering ﬂame of civilisation, albeit of the most twisted variety. Visitors to the Nexus seldom have need to venture into the outlands, as any chance of proﬁt that might be found in long-forgotten halls or vaults are outweighed by the dangers which plague such regions. However, there can be many reasons to leave the city, either to escape the Dark Eldar or ﬁnd a secret path that requires using old tunnels or hidden chambers. Occasionally individuals might be exiled into the outlands as a punishment, though this is usually reserved for \nDark Eldar, and only if the lord or noble passing the sentence \nwould ﬁnd it amusing to see their kin cast out. Most \ntransgressors are simply killed, and the exile of slaves \nis considered a waste when their death will occur \nunseen and unheard by the Dark Eldar. It is also \npossible to stray into the outlands \nby accident, as the Nexus has \nno clear boundaries or walls \n(especially in the depths \nof the Shadow"

A traveller might well become lost and wander for \ndays, meandering far from the city if luck is against him and only realising his error when he stumbles into an irradiated zone or falls prey to some deep, dark predator. A trip into the outlands, intentional or otherwise, could easily provide \nmaterial for an entire (if highly dangerous) separate Endeavour, \nand any sort of xenos horrors that the GM chooses could be \npresent, waiting within the wastes.\nTHE SUB-LEVELS\nThe majority of the Gaelan Sphere’s workings sit below its \nsurface, and hundreds of levels of tunnels and chambers reach down deep into the core. Many of these are completely inaccessible to travellers, and exist only to keep the sphere’s great machines working, while others are incomplete, still yet to be ﬁnished by the armies of fabricator-engines that ﬁll the sub-levels. Of those shafts that remain, though, there are still countless of kilometres of rooms and corridors stretching all across the sphere and connecting all of its major components and regions. The greatest concentration of these sub-levels \nexists around the three great command ziggurats, and each is \nconnected by a subterranean highway with central corridors large enough to ﬂy a ship through. Connected to these are thousands of additional junctions and tunnels, which link the ziggurats to other regions and zones, making it possible for a person to get to almost any point on the sphere from one of the great command pyramids, given enough time.\nTime and age have taken their toll on the sub-levels, and \nmany have collapsed or become sealed, ancient protocols closing heavy blast doors or purging sections to the void to protect the ziggurats against infection, radiation or inﬁltration by parasites. This has made what was already a confusing maze of tunnels and crossroads even more of a labyrinth, and almost impassable without at least some idea of the network’s original layout. Once, the ancient builders \nmay have used the sphere’s systems to guide them through \nthe tunnel system, the sphere’s great engine governing all \ntransit between the ziggurats and beyond, but now only \nthe most skilled can coax the wizened systems to life and \nget it to point the way. Even then the machine’s functionality has degraded and is largely incomplete. Like the mind of an old man, it remembers some things but has forgotten others, and using it as a guide comes with its own perils, such as the risk of being sent into a zone without air or gravity or one where the tunnel no longer exists at all.\nIn addition to the confusing layout and vast distances \nfound in the sub-levels, the chambers and tunnels are also ﬁlled with other dangers. While a traveller might be misled into thinking they are deserted, it is only their size which makes them appear so, and they can prove just as deadly as the crowded streets of the Shadow Arteries or the courts of the Dark Eldar lords. The primary peril of the sub-levels is \nthe sphere’s own ancient defences, which its builders put in \nplace to protect the sphere against invasion and inﬁltration. \nThough they have fallen into disrepair and the systems \nare but a shadow of their former strength, there \nremain many zones where deadly machines still \nlurk in sealed compartments or gun turrets still scan corridors for foes. Alien parasites and predators have \nalso come to call the sphere their home over the centuries. Some of these have claimed hunting grounds where they \nprey on each other or subsist on the detritus cast down from \nthe Nexus of Shadows. These beasts and vermin vary wildly \nin size and shape, having drifted in on space debris or in the holds of hulks that have crashed into the sphere’s surface, but all are dangerous to the unwary traveller. \nFUSION  CORE\nThe core of the Gaelan Sphere is hollow, a vast, open chamber of astronomical scale, surrounded by a shell of machines, engines, and generators wrought into the original asteroid from which the sphere was hewn. Some of the tunnels, and most notably the gravity-maw that the Cult of the Withered Blade uses as its arena, lead down into this core, and it is possible for an individual to come out of a corridor to ﬁnd himself standing on the edge of a great abyss looking down into what ﬁrst looks like a blazing sun. This “sun” is the fusion core itself, where ancient machines break down \nasteroids and other debris for usable minerals to fuel the \nrepair and construction of the sphere.

The sluggish and rusted defenders were no match for the advanced technology and tactics of the Dark Eldar, and thousands were destroyed as the aliens swept clean the tunnels and rooms that would become the Nexus. The aftermath of the battle saw piles of broken machines in almost every part of the Nexus, clogging up pathways and choking doors. \nEventually, the Dark Eldar used slaves to move this detritus \nout of the city, to areas now known as “the Corpse Pyres,” the dumping grounds for the denizens of the Nexus.\nacross the sphere and connecting all of its major components \nand regions. The greatest concentration of these sub-levels \nexists around the three great command ziggurats, and each is \nconnected by a subterranean highway with central corridors \nlarge enough to ﬂy a ship through. Connected to these are \nthousands of additional junctions and tunnels, which link the \nziggurats to other regions and zones, making it possible \nfor a person to get to almost any point on the sphere from \none of the great command pyramids, given enough time.\nTime and age have taken their toll on the sub-levels, and \nmany have collapsed or become sealed, ancient protocols \nclosing heavy blast doors or purging sections to the void \nto protect the ziggurats against infection, radiation or \ninﬁltration by parasites. This has made what was already a \nconfusing maze of tunnels and crossroads even more of a \nlabyrinth, and almost impassable without at least some idea \nof the network’s original layout. Once, the ancient builders \nmay have used the sphere’s systems to guide them through \nthe tunnel system, the sphere’s great engine governing all \ntransit between the ziggurats and beyond, but now only \nthe most skilled can coax the wizened systems to life and \nget it to point the way.

Though \nsearching the rubble is dangerous work, for the bodies and \nrubbish are prone to shifting suddenly and drowning the unwary in the husks of the dead, it promises great rewards. Functioning weapons and technology lie hidden in the \npits, beneath the shifting landscape of corpses. Xenos \npredators also ﬂock to the Corpse Pyres, which creates \nyet another threat to those who would remain overlong \nhunting for treasure While these opportunists dig for ancient technology and treasure, hungry eyes and slavering \njaws may well be following their every movement.\nTHE CENTRAL  CONSTELLATION\nThe Gaelan Sphere was created to be largely automated, its \nmillions of machines guided by global systems, perhaps to ease the burden on its living crew, allow its captains to focus on the task of studying the stars, or perform some other forgotten task. Time and decay, not to mention the damage the Dark Eldar have done, have destroyed much of the cogitator network that once governed the sphere, while in many areas the machines slumber awaiting the return of the sphere’s strangely missing crew. The central cluster of governing systems, called the Central Constellation by some hereteks who inhabit to the sphere, still works to a degree, and maintains the primary functions of the sphere, such as its repair and maintenance and the control of the \nfusion core. There is no single location where the constellation is \nlocated. Rather, it uses systems where and when they are needed, activating regions only for a time until its tasks are complete. If the constellation were to have access to more power, it could awaken more fully and restore control over the sphere, though to do so it would need fresh fuel for the fusion core (such as a sizeable asteroid or voidship) and the Dark Eldar have severed all its connections to the gravity-maw.\nThe constellation is aware of the presence of the Dark Eldar \nand their city and recognises them as intruders, though it lacks the means to expel them. For their part, the Dark Eldar do not see the constellation as a thinking machine, but rather a set of preordained responses to their presence, and consider it no threat. When an undiscovered automated defence system suddenly appears in a “safe” zone and kills some warriors, they see it only as the random ﬁts of an ancient and failing machine, which was ﬂawed in its creation. Thus far, it remains outside \nthe means of anyone, Dark Eldar, human, or alien, to master \nthe constellation, its vital systems hidden away in secret rooms across tens of thousands of kilometres of tunnels and rooms.Nexus of \nShadows \nEncounters\nThe Nexus is a vast place. From the lofty towers of the Bonespires to the dark depths of the sub-levels and outlands, it covers kilometres of tunnels, chambers, \nand zones. Wherever the Explorers go, the GM should try and impress upon them the contrast between the areas ruled by \nthe Dark Eldar, which incorporate a mix of alien and human \ndesign, to those beyond their control where ancient decaying \ncorridors give way to dust and debris-choked rooms often \nuntouched by the living for centuries.\nThe GM can use Table 0–1: Nexus of Shadows \nEncounters for ideas and inspiration any time the Explorers are travelling through the Nexus of Shadows during the adventure and beyond.\nACTIVE  DEFENCES\nBeyond the reaches of the city, the Gaelan Sphere has extensive defences against intrusion, many of these still perfectly operational. If the Explorers are on the alert for traps, they detect them by passing a Challenging (+0) Awareness \nTest, and can disable them with a Challenging (+0) Tech-\nUse Test. If the Explorers do not act quickly to disable the \ndefences, they open ﬁre with a number of guns equal to the number of Explorers. Each automated gun uses a \nBallistic Skill of 30, and ceases to function when hit \nby an attack from one of the Explorers. The guns use the following proﬁle: (Heavy; 90m; –/–/5; 1d10+7 I; Pen 2; Clip 50; Reload 2 Full).\nTable 0—1: \nTable 0—1: \nNexus of Shadows Encounters\nNexus of Shadows Encounters\n1d100 Roll Encounter\n1d100 Roll Encounter\n01–12\n Active Defences\n13–18\n Alien Scavengers\n19–24\n Ambush\n25–27\n Blood Pit\n28–41\n28–41\n Dark Eldar Patrol\n42–45\n Dark Eldar Hunters\n46–50\n Disrepair\n51–58\n Elite Dark Eldar Patrol\n59–64\n Elite Wych Cadre\n65–69\n Escaped Beasts\n70–73\n Escaped Slaves\n74–79\n Forgotten Defences\n80–82\n Noble Visitors\n83–88\n Outland Predators\n89–92\n Rad Zone\n93–00\n Wych Hunting Party"

The Explorers encounter a group of scavengers (which can be of any race, even human) hunting the sub-levels for anything of value. These scavengers pose no real threat to a party of Explorers, and make a scrabbling retreat if attacked. However, if the Explorers choose to deal with them, especially if they offer trade for the rubbish these unfortunates carry, they may be able to discover information that will aid them in goals such as reaching The Soul Reaver. \nThese scavengers could be unafﬁliated, or be a group of either \nSirissa’s crewmen scavenging for artefacts for the Cold Trade \nor of Henaris’ False Dawn cultists performing some clumsy \nritual (see Lesser Factions on page 12 for more information \non the sub-factions of the Nexus of Shadows).\nAMBUSH\nA group of thieves and brigands have ambushed the Explorers \nlooking for easy loot, though sorely underestimating their targets. This is a group of scum that is twice the number of the Explorers (or three times their number if they are Rank 4 or above), who will try to surprise the PCs by picking a good place to lie in wait before attacking. Cowards, the scum ﬂee if more than half of their number perish. See the proﬁle for Scum found on page 371 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core \nRulebook for desperate characters such as these.\nBLOOD  PIT\nThere are places in the Nexus where the Dark Eldar pile the butchered remains of household slaves or those who fought in the arenas for later disposal. The PCs have found such a place, a pit ﬁlled with the dead. The GM can use this encounter to introduce NPCs, such as half-dead slaves buried in the corpses, or offer up information, something on a corpse that helps them ﬁnd their way through the \nNexus of Shadows. Additionally, the GM should have \nevery Explorer make a Fear Test against a Fear Rating of 1 upon discovering one of these massacre scenes.\nDARK ELDAR  PATROL\nA cadre of Splintered Talon Kabalite Warriors (see page 122 for the Kabalite Warrior proﬁle) is either patrolling an area for the Archon or on its way to another part of the city. There should be twice as many Kabalite Warriors as there are Explorers, or three times as many if the Explorers are Rank 4 or above. For especially powerful groups of Explorers, the GM can add heavy weapons and vehicles to the patrol. These Dark Eldar are not inherently hostile to the Explorers unless \nthey have been told to look for such a group, but question \nthe presence of any aliens on the Nexus. The Explorers must pass an Ordinary (+10) Charm, Deceive, or Blather Test \nto avert the scrutiny of the patrol or else make an Opposed \nSilent Move or Concealment Test versus the Awareness of \nthe Dark Eldar to avoid their notice. If the Explorers fail \neither Test by more than 3 Degrees of Failure, the \nKabalite Warriors open ﬁre.DARK ELDAR  HUNTERS\nDark Eldar sometimes venture beyond the boundaries of the city in search of sport, hunting down escaped slaves or trying their skill against the sphere’s defences. This is a group of Splintered Talon Kabalite Warriors (see page 122 for the Kabalite Warrior Proﬁle) or Withered Blade Wyches (see page 124 for the Wych Proﬁle) equal in number to the Explorers and accompanied by two Khymerae used for hunting (see page 134 for the Khymera proﬁle). These Dark Eldar are not inherently hostile to the Explorers unless they have been told to look for such a group, but question the presence of any aliens on the \nNexus. The Explorers must pass a Difﬁcult (–10) Charm, \nDeceive, or Blather Test to avert the scrutiny of the patrol or \nelse make an Opposed Silent Move or Concealment Test versus \nthe Awareness of the Dark Eldar to avoid their notice. If the Explorers fail either Test by more than 3 Degrees of Failure, \nthe Dark Eldar or their beasts attack.\nDISREPAIR\nThe Explorers encounter area where the sphere has been \ndamaged and Dark Eldar never repaired. This could be collapsed ﬂoors or ceilings, wedged doors, or massive piles of debris clogging a tunnel. On their own, the Explorers would usually be able to navigate these areas given a bit of time. However, if they are being pursued or are otherwise in a hurry, this could become a signiﬁcant obstacle. To pass the obstacle in \na timely manner, each Explorer must pass a Challenging (+0) \nClimb, Contortionist, or Acrobatics Test as appropriate to \nget through, or a single Explorer with appropriate equipment must pass a Routine (+20) Demolition Test to blast \naway the debris or an adjoining wall (though, obviously, an explosion makes a great deal of noise).\nELITE DARK ELDAR  PATROL\nThe Explorers encounter a cadre of Kabalite Trueborn from the Kabal of the Splintered Talon (see page 123 for the Kabalite Trueborn proﬁle) either patrolling an area for the Archon or on its way to another part of the city, which may or may not attack on sight depending on the actions of the Explorers. There should be as many Kabalite Trueborn as there are Explorers, or twice as many if the Explorers are Rank 5 or above. For especially powerful groups of Explorers, the GM \ncan add extra heavy weapons and vehicles to the cadre. These \nDark Eldar are not inherently hostile to the Explorers unless they have been told to look for such a group, but question the presence of any aliens on the Nexus. The Explorers must pass a Hard (–20) Charm, Deceive, or Blather Test to avert the \nscrutiny of the patrol or else make an Opposed Silent Move or Concealment Test versus the Awareness of the Dark Eldar to avoid their notice. If the Explorers fail either Test by more than 3 Degrees of Failure, violence ensues.\nELITE W YCH CADRE\nThe way is blocked by a group of Withered Blade Hekatrix Bloodbrides (see page 124 for the Hekatrix Bloodbride proﬁle), which may or may not attack on sight depending on the actions of the Explorers. There should be as many Bloodbrides as there are Explorers, or twice as many if the Explorers are"

These Dark Eldar are not inherently hostile to the Explorers unless they have been told to look for such a group, but question the presence of any aliens on the Nexus. The Explorers must pass \na Hard (–20) Charm, Deceive, or Blather Test to avert the \nscrutiny of the patrol or else make an Opposed Silent Move \nor Concealment Test versus the Awareness of the Dark Eldar \nto avoid their notice. If the Explorers fail either Test by more than 3 Degrees of Failure, the Wyches attack.\nESCAPED  BEASTS\nA creature or number of creatures which have escaped (or been released) from their cages are wandering the tunnels of the sub-levels. This encounter can include single Khymera (see page 134 for the Khymera proﬁle), or one Khymera for each Explorer if the Explorers are Rank 3 or higher.\nESCAPED  SLAVES\nThe Explorers encounter a group of 3d10 escaped slaves (see page 129 for the Tormented Human proﬁle) who have been living in hiding. Fearful of discovery, they are willing to help the PCs in any way they can if they are not turned in, offering up what little they know of the Nexus of Shadows and the Dark Eldar to protect their freedom. Alternatively the Explorers could use them to gain favour with the Dark Eldar, sending them back to their masters for punishment. However, the slaves are unlikely to go back to a life of torment willingly.\nFORGOTTEN  DEFENCES\nWithin the Nexus there are areas where battle has damaged the sphere’s ancient defences, but they still function just enough to pose a temporary threat to passersby. These weapons are usually strewn around a site of obvious conﬂict, and the Explorers detect them if they pass a Challenging (+20) Awareness Test when \nentering the area. Unfortunately, given the damage that these turrets have suffered, they require an Arduous (–40) Tech-Use \nTest to disable. If the Explorers fail this Test, or linger too long after triggering the attention of the guns, they open ﬁre with a number of guns equal to the number of Explorers. Each automated gun uses a Ballistic Skill of 25, and ceases to function when hit by an attack from one of the Explorers or after 1d5 Rounds. The guns use the following proﬁle: (Heavy; 90m; –/–/5; 1d10+7 I; Pen 2; Clip 50; Reload 2 Full; Unreliable). NOBLE  VISITORS\nThese are a delegation of humans or aliens come to trade with the Dark Eldar. It is likely that they want nothing to do with Explorers who the Dark Eldar are hunting, though the PCs might be able to use them as cover or hostages. If they are human, the GM can use them to bring in NPCs from the Koronus Expanse or Calixis Sector, or have them connected to Imperial organisations the party has dealt with before. Alternatively, if the GM does not have an NPC prepared for such an occasion, either Sirissa or Henaris can be a part of the meeting (see Lesser Factions on page 12 for more \ninformation on the sub-factions of the Nexus of Shadows).\nOUTLAND  PREDATORS\nMore dangerous than the beasts that escape the arenas are those that live permanently beyond or below the Nexus. These horrors can take many forms, and the GM can use either the proﬁle for a Khymera to represent it (see page 134 for the Khymera proﬁle, and add +20 to Weapon Skill, Strength, and Toughness and +10 to its Wounds to reﬂect its feral status) or use a creature of his choosing, like a Warp Predator (Ebon \nGeist) from page 378 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook.\nRAD ZONE\nMany areas in the sphere are toxic to life and dangerous even to \nenter. When the Explorers reach this zone, they become aware of high levels of radiation (void suit indicators or auspexes alerting them). Passing through such a zone requires a Difﬁcult \n(–10) Toughness Test every hour to resist gaining a level of Fatigue that can only be removed by medicae treatment and ritual cleansing. The curative process requires an Ordinary \n(+10) Medicae Test and at least one full day outside of Rad Zones. A character who falls unconscious from this kind of \nFatigue succumbs to the radiation and dies.\nWYCH HUNTING  PARTY\nThe Explorers run across a cadre of Dark Eldar Wyches (see \npage 124 for the Wych proﬁle), marauding through the lower depths of the city, which may or may not attack on sight depending on the actions of the Explorers. These Dark Eldar are not inherently hostile to the Explorers unless they have been told to look for such a group, but question the \npresence of any aliens on the Nexus. The Explorers must pass \na Difﬁcult (–10) Charm, Deceive, or Blather Test to avert \nthe scrutiny of the patrol or else make an Opposed Silent Move or Concealment Test versus the Awareness of the Dark Eldar to avoid their notice. If the Explorers fail either Test by more than 3 Degrees of Failure, the Wyches immediately initiate hostilities. The patrol numbers twice as many Wyches as there are Explorers, or three times as many if the Explorers are Rank 4 or above. For especially powerful groups of Explorers, the GM can add additional exotic weapons."

However, even a king, or a queen, may from time to time ﬁnd herself in need of childish things…”\n–Salaine Morn, Archon of the Shadowed Thorns Kabal\nThe Soul Reaver centres on Archon Salaine Morn’s plan to take back the Nexus of Shadows and destroy her rivals for control of this Dark Eldar outpost. For \nthe GM, this means that how the Explorers meet Salaine, their relationship with her, and the kind of deal they strike with her and her Kabal have an overarching effect on the plot and its ﬁnal outcome. The ﬁrst part of the adventure therefore focuses \non the PCs’ meeting with Salaine, the formulation of a plan \nto take back her city, and the creation of some kind of accord between the Explorers and the Dark Eldar Archon. The GM can then use this foundation to inﬂuence other aspects of the adventure and the reactions of Salaine and other important NPCs, not to mention the ﬁnal outcome of the adventure and any rewards the Explorers might garner for themselves.\nThere are numerous ways in which the Explorers can \nencounter Salaine Morn and her Kabal, and the GM should choose one that suits the nature of his group and plays to their ambitions and the desires of their characters, whether they are driven by the need for wealth, vengeance, or faith in the God-Emperor. Because Salaine is an alien, and a dangerous one at that, some groups of Explorers might have trouble dealing with her or ﬁnd it difﬁcult to trust her enough to even entertain anything she has to say, preferring instead to \nshoot ﬁrst and praise the God-Emperor for their handiwork \nlater. Therefore before the adventure begins, the GM should consider the best way for Salaine to meet the group and how a measure of accord, if not true trust, might be fostered between the Archon and the Explorers that can lead to them helping her further her plans and thus launch the adventure.The Thorns of \nCommorragh\n“Humans employ subtlety when they lack the power to take what they want, but the Eldar are always infuriatingly subtle., no matter the power they wield. Forget this at your own peril.”\n–Inquisitor Isamira Tiraske\nThe adventure begins with the Explorers meeting the Dark Eldar Archon, Salaine Morn, and forming some manner of alliance or deal with her. How and where \nthis occurs and why the Explorers would choose to make any kind of deal with a xenos pirate depends greatly on their own \nmotivations, but Salaine is a cunning negotiator and driven by a \ndeep desire for vengeance against her rivals. When she decides the Explorers are the people to help her get what she wants, she will make sure they come around to her way of thinking.\nPresented here are a number of different ways in which the \nExplorers could come into contact with Salaine and the kinds of deals and offers she might make with the Player Characters. To help the GM decide the best way for his players to become involved with Salaine, these various possibilities are divided into ways in which the Dark Eldar could be encountered and the kinds of motivations Salaine tries to exploit to get the Explorers to help her in her plans. The GM should consider each of these encounters and motivations before the adventure begins and choose the ones that best suit his group. He can also use them as inspiration for his introduction to the Dark Eldar \nas a whole, altering them as necessary to suit the needs of his \ncampaign or incorporating his own existing NPCs into them. \nDARK ENCOUNTERS\nThe Koronus Expanse is a vast and dangerous place, and \nduring the Explorers’ travels there are numerous ways in which they might encounter Salaine. She might engineer an encounter with the PCs upon hearing of their prowess, or others might offer up the Rogue Trader and his ship to the Archon. Several speciﬁc encounters that might be used to bring the Explorers’ into Salaine’s plot are listed below:\nAN ANOMALOUS  ENCOUNTER\nImmediately after translation out of the warp, the Explorers’ vessel becomes trapped in a celestial anomaly that seems to be a swirling well of light in the void. A number of other vessels have been snared by this phenomenon, and are also locked in an orbit around it. This includes Salaine Morn’s vessel, a Dark Eldar Torture-class cruiser, the Promise of Agony (see page 137 for the proﬁle of a Torture-class cruiser). The GM must be careful throughout in this kind of scenario never to have \nSalaine truly at the mercy of the Explorers; she always has \nwarriors on hand and she never seems quite as trapped by the situation as the Explorers, though a fair amount of this will be her natural conﬁdence (see the Roleplaying Salaine Morn \nsidebar on page 29. Salaine offers her assistance in escaping the phenomenon; she has the knowledge required to break"

Unfortunately, there are also several pirate \nvessels trapped in the anomaly’s pull who hope to raid new ships to have entered their prison, and the Explorers must work with Salaine to disable these ships (either by boarding action, ship-to-ship battle, or some of both) so that they can \nsteal one key component from each pirate vessel that Salaine \nneeds to execute the escape plan. The pirate vessels use the \nproﬁle for Hazeroth-class privateers found on page 194 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook.\nIf the GM wants, Salaine could even have engineered the \nsituation that forces the Explorers to rely on her aid to escape. Perhaps she lured their ship into the anomaly, and remains in control of events despite her apparent predicament. If the GM \ndoes choose to have Salaine behind the Explorers’ problems, \nthen he should make sure that her duplicity only becomes apparent much later in the adventure rather than giving the \nExplorers the chance to discover they have been duped early \non and derailing their chances of ever getting to the Nexus of \nShadows as they turn on the Archon.\nSalaine makes her deals with the Explorers before they are \nfreed from the anomaly or returned to their ship to ensure that \nthey understand that she is doing them a favour and expects one returned in kind. While it is possible that the Explorers might help the Archon out of mere kindness, Salaine is not so trusting nor so naïve and will make sure they understand the price of her aid before she gives it. The GM should not feel he needs to force the issue, though. If the Explorers are willing to go along with Salaine, or at least hear what she has to offer, he need only remind them of any agreements they might have made if they start to get cold feet. Once Salaine has the Explorers’ ears, she then tries to seal the deal by making them \nan offer (see Dark Desires (page 29 for some of the methods \nand temptations that she might use to motivate them). \nDARK DEEDS  REMEMBERED\nEvery Rogue Trader has a reputation either for good or ill, and \nit trails him like a vessel’s warp-wake everywhere he passes. This reputation is more far-reaching than many a Rogue Trader even realises, and falls on the most unexpected of ears. For whatever reason, Salaine Morn has heard of the Explorers and their deeds and has decided they are precisely the kinds of individuals she needs to take back the Nexus. This could be because out of all the denizens of the Koronus Expanse, Salaine considers the PCs just right for the task, their past endeavours and the nature of their dealings with others meaning that they possess the proper mix of potential sympathy to her cause and \nthe skills to complete it. Equally it could be that amongst all \nthe members of her renegade ﬂeet, she still lacks both a ship and a crew with the ability to crack the defences of the Nexus of Shadows and rip out The Soul Reaver, and the Explorers are \nmerely the closest vessel on hand that might possibly come to her aid. Whatever the reason, Salaine attempts to set up a meeting with the Explorers to try and make a deal with them.\nSalaine is as wary of the Explorers as they are likely to \nbe unsure of her, and she ﬁrst wants to assess her potential allies before she meets them. As such, she sends a human intermediary, Skallag Egil, a pirate captain from her renegade ﬂeet who approaches the Explorers with a mysterious offer when they set in at an appropriate port. Skallag invites them to a seedy local establishment to ﬁnd out if they are suited to this task. The Explorers have the chance impress Skallag, and can do this by succeeding at a Challenging (+0) Charm \nTest to win him over with their words or an Arduous (–40) Carouse Test to prove their mettle otherwise. If they succeed on one of these Tests, the Explorers convince Skallag of their worthiness. If they fail, he insists upon inspecting their vessel ﬁrst, and the Explorers must demonstrate its power to him in a suitable fashion. Once Skallag has been convinced, one way or the other, he brings them to Salaine to discuss the speciﬁcs of the job. Skallag does not volunteer the fact that Salaine is a Dark Eldar Archon, but makes no particular secret of it if asked once the Explorers are in his good graces.\nThe GM can also use this method of introduction to link the \nEndeavours within T\nHE SOUL REAVER  to another adventure. \nIt could be that one of the Explorers’ previous Endeavours was in fact a task set for them by Salaine (in which case, she might approach them more directly). Alternatively, she might ask an intermediary like Skallag to observe the Explorers while they complete a short Endeavour (either created by the GM and Explorers or as part of another adventure entirely). At the end of the adventure, the intermediary then tells the Explorers of an interested party who has observed their skill \nand wants to meet with them."

The GM could use an existing NPC, either an ally or a rival, to draw the PCs into joining the renegade ﬂeet and only then have them meet with Salaine. For years, the Archon has been gathering forces to take back the Nexus, at ﬁrst recruiting Dark Eldar allies and then looking further aﬁeld when these sources have dried up. With her own Kabal still greatly reduced after the battle with the Kabal of the Splintered Talon that ousted her from the Nexus, she needs troops and ships to see her plans come \nto fruition. She has been manipulating and recruiting pirates \nand renegades from across the Expanse for some years now, \nselecting only those strong enough to be of use to her plan. While many of these vessels and captains are barely worthy of the name, being merely bloodthirsty aliens and degenerate \nhumans looking for proﬁt, some powerful individuals may \nhave sensed true potential for wealth in the alliance.\nThe NPC with connections to the Explorers is one such \nindividual, and along with his ship (either his own or one acquired in some other way), he has joined with the Archon. He offers an invitation to the PCs, perhaps as a favour returned, bringing them into what he perceives as a chance at great wealth. If he is a rival, it might instead be a subtle ploy to see the Explorers in the vanguard of the assault on the Nexus and claim their Dynasty when they fall in battle. The NPC can be almost anyone the Explorers have previously come into contact with, though it should be either someone they trust or someone of signiﬁcant power (like another Rogue Trader) whose offer is more difﬁcult to refuse.\nOnce the Explorers join the renegade ﬂeet and make their \nﬁrst meeting with Salaine, she instantly recognises their \npotential for her plans and makes them a favourable offer. She \nalso sees them as the ﬁnal piece she needs to begin her attack on the Nexus and pushes her plans into action. The GM can then have the NPC who brought them to Salaine either fade into the background, or more interestingly, use him to complicate matters as the adventure progresses. Certainly, if the NPC is a fellow Rogue Trader, he probably insists on being party to the plan to steal The Soul Reaver and seeks to \njoin the Explorers as they try and inﬁltrate the Nexus. This can lead to all manner of complications, not least should the NPC choose to side with the Kabal of the Splintered Talon once he sees the reigning Kabal’s power ﬁrst hand.\nTHREATS  AND TREATIES\nWhile Salaine is more inclined to coax the Explorers \ninto an alliance with offers of wealth and power, in \ncertain circumstances she might decide to get their \naid through coercion. The GM should only \nconsider this path if making any kind of alliance with the Dark Eldar would be completely against the motivations of the group. If for instance the Explorers have close ties to the Ministorum or Puritan elements of the Inquisition, they might never consider willingly working for a xenos, and certainly not one as dangerous and repulsive as a Dark Eldar Archon. In this instance, the GM can present a situation in which the players must do the Archon’s bidding because it represents the lesser of two evils.\nThe means of coercion should be such that it prompts the \nExplorers to action but also does not simply provoke them to \nattack Salaine directly. No group of players likes being told \nwhat to do or feeling that they are powerless to alter their fate, and so the GM should go to lengths to engineer a situation in \nwhich they believe that doing Salaine’s bidding will led them \nto a chance to both achieve a tangible goal for themselves or a greater good. The GM can achieve this in a number of ways: Salaine might know the location of something of value to the Explorers that they have lost and refuses to reveal it until they have stolen The Soul Reaver. This should be something \nof immense value to them (like their Warrant of Trade, a lost loved one, or a holy relic of St. Drusus, for example) and it should also be essentially out of their reach without the Archon’s help. She could alternatively hint at a future attack by the Kabal of the Splintered Talon upon one of their worlds, which threatens to massively impact their Proﬁt Factor, but again withhold the key information until the Explorers assist \nher. Whatever it is, the GM should maintain the impression \nthat if the Explorers travel to the Nexus and try to steal The \nSoul Reaver, they eventually get their chance to both get what they want and repay Salaine for her manipulation. Particularly zealous Explorers might also be tempted with the chance to destroy the Nexus of Shadows, or at least disrupt the Dark Eldar’s trade networks.\nTEARS  OF THE M ACHINE  GOD\nThe Adeptus Mechanicus has long had an interest in the Gaelan Sphere, and has over the centuries dispatched Explorators into the Koronus Expanse to ﬁnd it. The most recent of these was Magos Domos Agnelain, who though he found the location of the long-lost sphere but also fell prey to the Dark Eldar who inhabit it and was enslaved. Domos’ expedition is recent enough to still live in the memories of the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Calixis Sector, and there are numerous Magos on the Lathe Worlds and beyond who still wonder at his disappearance. The GM can use this plot hook to lead the Explorers to a meeting with Salaine and an alliance to inﬁltrate the Nexus, whether \nas fully-ﬂedged members of the Archon’s renegade ﬂeet or \nas part of a mission from the Adeptus Mechanicus to recover Domos and locate the Gaelan Sphere.\nThe GM can start by having the Explorers receive an \ninvitation to the Lathes from the Mechanicus, and from there have a meeting with high-ranking members of the Calixian Machine Cult. The Explorers then need to follow clues and piece together Domos’ trail as he left the Calixis Sector and ventured into the Expanse, which requires a Challenging \n(+0) Inquiry Test on a Mechanicus world or a Difﬁcult \n(–10) Logic Test with Domos’ logs and then a Hard (–20) \nNavigation Test to actually reach his last known destination (though the Explorers receive a +20 bonus to this Test if they"

These Tests may \nbe repeated as necessary, but the Explorers should encounter complications, resistance, or other snags after each failure. The advantage of using this method of introduction is that it allows the GM to introduce information about the sphere before the PCs reach the Nexus, and makes the players more sympathetic to Domos when they ﬁnally meet him. It can also \nbe spun out into an adventure in its own right and makes for \na good way to segue a campaign that is currently based in or near the Calixis Sector into the Koronus Expanse.\nOnce the Explorers follow the trail into the Expanse, they \nencounter Salaine, either stumbling on the location of the renegade ﬂeet or drawing her attention when they start asking a few too many of questions about the Gaelan Sphere. From this point, things can proceed depending on the nature of the Explorers and could lead to either a change in their plans—forsaking the search for Domos to seek proﬁt though alliance with the Archon—or using such an alliance as a means to an end to rescue the lost Magos. This path might also be useful for groups loathe to work with xenos, since recovering the lost Tech-Priest is an admirable goal for those faithful to the God-Emperor or the Omnissiah, and Salaine’s presence and plot would be a necessary evil to achieve it. Another NPC, either from the Explorers’ own histories or from those trapped on \nthe Nexus of Shadows and described in this book, could serve \nin Domos’ place as a similar impetus to launch the adventure.\nDARK DESIRES\nSalaine Morn has dealt with dozens of alien races, including humans, and has a keen understanding of what can motivate such creatures, even if she does not always understand why. She offers the Explorers just enough to get them to do what she wants, whether or not she ever intends on delivering.BLOOD  M ONEY\nThe most straightforward way to entice the Explorers into a deal with Salaine is proﬁt. By taking over the Nexus and destroying the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, Salaine will be able to offer the PCs a substantial amount of wealth (provided they are not too picky about its source). For many crews, this is probably enough, and she need not go much further, and even if she does need to convince them to aid her in a \ndifferent way, money is still likely to be a part of any deal. \nExactly how much and what form this proﬁt takes is up to the GM (see Proﬁt and Achievement on page 94 for more \nguidance on Proﬁt Factor rewards for stealing The Soul Reaver \nand helping Salaine take power), though it will most likely be rooted in the lucrative slave trade of the Nexus.\nGM G UIDANCE : R OLEPLAYING  SALAINE  M ORN\nArchon Salaine Morn is a prominent NPC throughout this adventure and how she deals with the Explorers, and is dealt with by them, will have a signiﬁcant effect on how events occur. The key thing to remember when running Salaine is that she is an alien who hails from a self-involved and sadistic species that shares few if any of the morals with humanity. While she can be trusted not to betray the Explorers unless it is directly and unquestionably to her own beneﬁt, she never regards them as her equals, either. Despite the fact that she needs their assistance, she always views them as tools to complete her \ntask and never as true allies. Salaine is completely consumed with her desire to recover control of the Nexus and enact her \nvengeance on Zaergarn Kul, and this remains at the core of all of her motivations. She is willing to risk personal danger and discomfort, and might even adopt a certain degree of humility if it means achieving this goal, though she will not sell \nher life for it. As long as the Explorers are useful to her (which they should be for the majority of the adventure) she treats \nthem as valuable tools, with exactly as much respect and cordiality as required to get them to dance to her tune.\nWhen roleplaying Salaine, the GM should try to repeatedly remind the Explorers just how alien she is to them, in case \nthey forget they have made a pact with a Dark Eldar. Apart from her cruel beauty and elegance, which no human could hope to emulate, she also only has a limited grasp of human culture. The GM can use this to have “lost in translation” moments where she misunderstands or is misunderstood by the Explorers. This will be most obvious when it comes to matters of morality, considering that Salaine sees nothing wrong with torture and killing or enjoying the suffering of others. In fact, many human concepts like compassion and mercy are lost on her, and she might even think the Explorers are trying to make a joke should they speak against slavery or cold-blooded murder. Such culture clash incidents can help to reinforce that Salaine’s ambition and sadism are not deviant characteristics, as they would be in a particularly wicked human, but are ingrained in her on a normative and even physiological level. She, like all other Dark Eldar, does not merely enjoy the suffering of others, but actively requires it to sustain herself. Whether these misunderstandings draw the players’ \ninterest, hatred, or even pity, they can provide interesting opportunities for roleplaying during the campaign."

      "text": "30\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nA F EAST  OF VENGEANCE\nAll Rogue Traders have enemies and scores to settle, whether \nit is against an individual or organisation that has wronged them personally or someone that slighted their dynasty in centuries past. Salaine can offer assistance in completing this vengeance once she is in control of the Nexus of Shadows. With its resources and the aid of the restored Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns and Cult of the Withered Blade, she will be able to lend a substantial force, or exceptionally skilled assassins, to the Rogue Trader’s cause. The GM could even have had her research the Explorers and their enemies and \nhave some names on hand when she makes the offer. This \ncan be especially appropriate if the GM has an NPC or two \nwho have been causing the Explorers pain in their campaign, and the offer to assassinate those individuals or destroy their power-base might be more of a draw than simple money \nalone. Of course, once Salaine is in control of the Nexus and \nthe assassins dispatched, what happens next is up to the GM, and could even be an adventure in its own right.\nFORBIDDEN  TECH\nDark Eldar do not have the same restrictions on their use and understanding on technology as the Imperium and the generally close-minded notions of its citizens. The GM can use the opportunity to gain of powerful alien technology (be it personal weapons, void ship components, or something else) to bribe the Explorers into action if raw monetary wealth alone seems too hollow a reward. This can be a good way for the GM to introduce technology into his campaign or enhance the Explorers’ vessel if he wants, and as with all things touched by xenos, brings with it its own set of problems and \nadventure possibilities. If the GM chooses, he could even offer \nthe Explorers something they would never otherwise have a chance to obtain, like a functioning Dark Eldar vehicle or ship, which they can then add to their dynasty and use in future Endeavours. However, even possessing such a device, let alone using one, is a heavily proscribed act, and the Explorers should be warned not to bring it into Imperial space.\nWORLDS  UNCHARTED\nSalaine has travelled far and wide across the Koronus Expanse and beyond, visiting places no human ship has ever seen. During this time she has gathered hundreds of star charts and secret routes through the webway. She might offer some of these charts to the Explorers if they are not overly concerned with wealth or are averse to proﬁting from the slavery of the Nexus. What these charts \nshow and where they lead is up to the GM, though they \ncould conceivably mark out many unsettled worlds ripe for proﬁt or the location of ancient and forgotten treasures. The charts might also shed light on the webway within the Expanse, and with the right Eldar technology alongside the \nmaps, might even allow the Explorers to use the webway \nto reach certain far-ﬂung destinations, cutting down \ntheir transit time and even reducing their exposure \n(and therefore danger) from the warp. AN ALIEN ALLIANCE\nArchon Salaine Morn has gathered to her a small army of Dark Eldar, alien mercenaries, and human pirates to aid her in her recovery of the Nexus. The size and make-up of this ﬂeet is up to the GM and can be as large or small as he chooses. The purpose of the ﬂeet is to give Salaine the strength to \noppose the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and have a suitably \nspectacular battle in the ﬁnal chapter when her ﬂeet clashes \nwith the forces defending the Nexus. It also gives Salaine \nmore presence and power when dealing with the PCs while also allowing her own Kabal to appear diminished and \nstruggling to survive. The renegade ﬂeet should be a motley \nband of vessels and crews, which can have representatives from almost any of the denizens of the Koronus Expanse or beyond. The GM can also use the ﬂeet to reintroduce races or NPCs that might have appeared earlier in his campaign, or which he wishes to use later as plot hooks for further adventures. The Explorers should stand out among the ﬂeet, however, as individuals of power and means (this is, after all, why Salaine has chosen them to inﬁltrate the Nexus) with the most impressive ship and the most capable crew.\nTHE RENEGADE  FLEET\nOnce the PCs have become acquainted with Salaine (through one or more of the ways detailed above) she invites them to a council of her allies (which includes the remains of her Kabal and the ﬂeet of pirates and renegades she has gathered) and tells them of her plans to take back her city, which was so foully taken from her. The GM can have this ﬁrst meeting play out in a number of ways, depending on how the PCs have come to join the Dark Eldar ﬂeet, though Salaine tries to make a memorable ﬁrst impression and gives a display of power during this encounter by showing her dominance over \nher ﬂeet, and demonstrating the reason why she should rule \nthe Nexus. Thus, the meeting will most likely take place on \nher ship, Aeon of Torment, in her audience chambers. The GM \ncan read or paraphrase the following when the PCs are ﬁrst \nushered to these chambers by her bodyguards:\nYou are ushered into a huge vaulted chamber by masked alien guards, their wickedly curved power glaives and black, pitiless eyes carefully following your movements. Under a grand dome of shadows and cold, hard stars, a lithe alien warlord sits upon a throne of thorns and blades, her ghostly pale skin and graceful beauty standing in stark contrast to the darkness and twisted carvings of tormented faces adorning the ﬂoors and walls around her. Flanked by two tall, armoured guards she gazes imperiously \ndown upon you and those around you; glancing about the audience \nchamber, you can see other captains and ship-lords gathered in \ngroups before the Archon, equally unsettled by the presence of the \nDark Eldar, but ready to make an alliance with this woman and her race for the chance at proﬁt, glory, and great reward.\nIn this ﬁrst formal encounter with Salaine, the GM should \nestablish the parameters of a deal with the Explorers and strike a pact between them and the Archon. Using the motivations and rewards mentioned above, the GM should make sure that by the time the Explorers depart they know why they are aiding"

This encounter can therefore be as long or as brief as the GM desires as long as it fulﬁls this purpose. In addition to establishing the Explorers’ pact with Salaine, \nthe GM can also use this meeting to give the players some \nback story on Salaine and the Nexus covered in A Mournful \nTale. The GM should not feel he needs to tell the players the \nwhole story right away, but can use any or all of it to give the \nExplorers an idea of what they are getting into and foster some \nlevel of understanding between them and the Archon. As part \nof making an alliance, Salaine also unveils her plan to take back the Nexus, and the role she wants the Explorers to play in this dark design. This is detailed below in The Plan on page 32. \nA M OURNFUL  TALE\nArchon Salaine Morn of the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns was cast out from Commorragh decades ago after losing favour among her kin, and was forced into exile. She spent many years wandering the webway and the void in search of a new home for her Kabal. Eventually, she discovered an ancient artiﬁcial \nmoon (a human artefact lost during long ages past and known as \nthe Gaelan Sphere) trapped partially in the webway. She could \nnot overcome the moon’s defences alone, nor hold it against \nattack once she did, and so she made an alliance with the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and its Archon, Zaergarn Kul. Together the Archons took the moon, which they named the “Nexus of Shadows,” and created a powerful base from which to raid and trade with the denizens of the nearby regions of the Koronus Expanse, Calixis Sector, and the Screaming Vortex.\nLike any Dark Eldar with the ambition to rise to the lofty \nposition of Archon, Salaine was not content to share her prize, however, and sought to absorb Zaergarn’s Kabal into her own. Part of her plot involved inviting the Withered Blade Wych Cult to join the Archons in running the Nexus, under the pretence that the Cult would bring in more slaves and help \norganise games to draw more traders and allies. In league with \nthe Cult of the Withered Blade, Salaine began to build her \nstrength to oppose Zaergarn and destroy him. Zaergarn himself \nwas not idle, and was aware that the time would come when \nSalaine would move against him, or he might be ready to move against her, and so began repairing and activating the sphere’s network of powerful defensive towers, ostensibly to protect the Nexus from raiders (of which there were no shortage from the Screaming Vortex), but also so that he might have control over all ships entering and leaving the Nexus.\nThis build-up of power might have continued for many years, \neach side making minor attacks against the other, if something had not entered the Nexus that changed everything. As part of his quest for allies to use against Salaine, Zaergarn had dealings with all manner of aliens and creatures of the void, trading everything from slaves to secrets. One such deal was with a Stryxis trader who brought him news of something sitting dormant far beyond the Halo Stars, the hulk of an alien ship of graceful and incalculably ancient design, corrupted and sickened by the lonely millennia, \nbut potent nonetheless. At its heart rested a device, studded with \nthousands of faintly glowing stones and bristling with terrifying power. Zaergarn recognized the ancient vessel immediately upon retrieving it, and installed it in the centre of his palace.With The Soul Reaver, Zaergarn was able to channel energy \nfrom every death that occurred in or near the Nexus and turn it into raw power for his Kabal and, more importantly, the defence network he had been building. Unaware of this development, Salaine made her move and ordered her ﬂeet to attack the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, assuming that the two Archons still shared control of the defence network. She also took the further precaution of using her elite soldiers to disable the generators that powered it. She made alliance with the Cult of the Withered Blade, and, as a ﬁnal measure, dispatched a vile Mandrake to enter Zaergarn’s palace and kill him.\nSomehow, despite the thoroughness of her attack from \nall angles upon her rival Archon, the plan collapsed around her. When Salaine began her attack, the towers which her lieutenants and Wych Cult allies had told her were inactive suddenly sprang to life and carved a bloody swathe through her ﬂeet. Worse still, somehow Zaergarn had seemingly survived her assassin, issuing his orders through the Haemonculus Drecarus. As the ﬁnely wrought plan fell to pieces, the Cult of the Withered Blade chose to change sides and made parley with the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns before retreating to their own sections of the city. Outmatched and with no aid coming, Salaine was forced to retreat, leaving the Kabal of the Splintered Talon in command of the city. Even as she drew the remaining fragments of her host back into the shadows, Salaine Morn swore she would return to reclaim the Nexus, and to exact her bitter toll of revenge."

      "text": "32\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nTHE PLAN\nSalaine’s plan is to retake the Nexus and kill Zaergarn Kul, \nthough while he controls The Soul Reaver, the city and his \nfortress remain nigh impregnable. Salaine knows that if she were to launch an assault on the city with The Soul Reaver still \nactive, Zaergarn could use it to not only power but also boost the output of the Razor’s Web, and her ﬂeet would be hard-pressed to make a landing, let alone win the ensuing battle. On top of the problem presented by the defence network, Zaergarn can use The Soul Reaver to awaken the Gaelan Sphere’s \nown defences and power the weapons of his Kabal. Worse, as \nshe has learned from her spies in the city after her ﬁrst defeat, \nthe more of Salaine’s army that is killed and the more of \nZaergarn’s troops who die in the defence of the city, the more energy the Archon will have to use for his weapons as The Soul \nReaver funnels the essence of the dead into raw power.\nBecause of the critical importance of The Soul Reaver, Salaine \nhas devised a plan to take it out of the equation before she launches her attack, and thus swing the odds back into her favour. While it might be possible to destroy The Soul Reaver, Salaine has \nno idea what effects this might have, and regardless, she covets the power of the alien artefact for herself. Therefore, she wants to steal it, drag it away from the city, and turn it to her own ends once she understands how Zaergarn uses it to absorb the power of the dead. This is an audacious plan, as it amounts to nothing less than tearing a voidship free of its place built into the heart of Zaergarn’s ziggurat, dragging it out of the city, and then out of the webway to guarantee that its connection to the sphere is entirely severed. Once it is removed, Salaine’s ﬂeet can strike—it must still contend with the voidships of the Splintered Talon, of course, but with surprise on her side, victory would be within her grasp.\nTo achieve this, Salaine tells the Explorers that they need \nto inﬁltrate the Nexus and ﬁnd a way into the Archon’s palace. The Soul Reaver stands at the centre of the palace, its \nhull secured amidst the towers that sprout from the ziggurat and make up the core of the Archon’s palace. Charges must be set around the base and sides of the vessel to destroy the supports and web of walkways holding it in place and sever it from the grid that powers the Razor’s Web. The Explorers must also enter the lonely halls of the cursed ship itself to place a device that Salaine provides, which she claims can \nboth scramble any automated defences the vessel may possess \nand give her critical information about The Soul Reaver. Salaine \nwarns the Explorers from personal experience that the ship’s  \ntwisting corridors and vast, empty chambers are both difﬁcult to navigate and unsettling in the extreme, and asks may even openly question whether or not the Explorers are suited to the task, especially if she thinks they need an extra push to agree to the mission. Once they agree, she tells them to seek out a jeweled pedestal within a main chamber to which all routes should eventually lead, and place the device there.\nOnce the device and the charges are in place, the \nExplorers’ vessel must make a run on the palace, slide through the Archon’s defences, and grapple massive tow-cables onto The Soul Reaver’s prow. Then it must tear the ship free and \ndrag it away, robbing the Kabal of the Splintered Talon of the artefact’s near endless power. At the same time that the Explorers are making their escape in their vessel, Salaine’s renegade ﬂeet can commence its attack.\nSalaine has chosen the Explorers for such a daring and \nbold plan for two reasons: ﬁrstly they are among the only individuals with the power and skill to reach the Archon’s palace and place the charges. Secondly, their ship is among the best in the renegade ﬂeet, and the only one with the brute strength to successfully drag The  Soul Reaver into the void.\nSalaine and some of her ﬁnest warriors accompany the \nExplorers to the surface of the Nexus, and though they cannot help them sneak into the palace, they can assist the Explorers in the city if needed before Salaine goes off to complete other tasks, such as trying to manipulate the Cult of the Withered Blade into staying out of the ensuing battle and disabling \nthe back-up power sources for the Razor’s Web. However, \nif the Explorers draw too much attention to themselves, \nor become involved in any protracted combat encounters, \nespecially against the forces of the Kabal of the Splintered \nTalon, Salaine and her warriors might simply vanish into the shadows at the GM’s discretion."

Here, you can while away the idle days away from the plots of great nobles and focus on what truly matters. Here, you can meet a plethora of fascinating new species and learn so many things about them: how they live, how they die, how to take them apart. And most importantly, how to wrench out their best screams.”\n–Haemonculus Anasta Skaiene\nOnce the Explorers have ﬁnalised their plans with Salaine, they are ready to enter the Nexus of Shadows and begin their inﬁltration. The renegade \nﬂeet gathers and stands ready at the entrance to the webway, with only the Explorers’ vessel (with Salaine and some of her warriors on board) making its way in. The transition into the webway is quite unlike entering the warp. As ever, \nthe Eldar have found a method that is far more graceful \nand elegant than any used by humanity. As their ship slips through the gateway (hidden in the wilds of a remote system, which they reach only with Salaine’s guidance), the endless night of the void changes slightly and the stars glitter and vanish, while an unnatural silence falls over the Explorer’s ship. The journey to the Nexus of Shadows does not take long, though as their ship progresses, the Explorers get the sense that they are ﬂicking between junctions and additional gateways, unseen in the dark but known to Salaine. Finally, hanging in the night before them, they see what appears at ﬁrst glance to be a small moon.As the Explorers approach the Nexus of Shadows, the GM \nshould read or paraphrase the following:\nLike a grain of grey sand on a beach of darkness, the Nexus of Shadows hangs in the void, its coarse steel and shadowed surface studded with towers and crisscrossed by deep artiﬁcial canyons, and its face lit by an unseen sun. As your ship draws closer, the sheer size of the sphere becomes clear, many times larger than the \ngreatest ship of the Imperial Fleet or the mightiest of the God-\nEmperor’s space fortresses. Drawing closer still, you can now make \nout the Dark Eldar city sprawling across its surface; dark twisted towers and warped structures clustered together like carrion on a corpse. Though only occupying a small fraction of the sphere, \nthe city still rivals the largest hives of Scintilla, with doubtless \ncountless levels hidden beneath its shadowed streets. Above the city, in the airless vacuum of low orbit, your vessel joins dozens of others, most of them alien in design, entering or leaving the city.\nHow the adventure proceeds from here depends on the \ntactics chosen by the PCs, and whether they want to stride in as merchants looking to trade, sneak in as quietly as possible, or simply try and blast their way to the palace. All three of these are viable options, as are any number of other possibilities that the Explorers may wish to attempt. More \nThan One Way to Steal a Ship on page 35 describes some ways in which the Explorers might use social cunning, stealth, or force to reach their destination, but the GM should not feel constrained to these options if the players have other ideas.\nI K NOW  THAT  YOU  \nKNOW  THAT  I K NOW ...\nSalaine’s plan, while solid in concept, is based in part on faulty intelligence. She, like virtually everyone else, assumes that Zaergarn is still in command of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, unaware that Drecarus in fact rules the Kabal, having betrayed his employer by leaving his spirit sealed within The Soul Reaver  itself \nafter it became trapped there during the assassination attempt years ago. Drecarus is no less arrogant or decadent than his former “master,” but he is far more calculating, and has equipped The Soul Reaver —and \nits core—with devices that monitor it at all times, to make sure that the vengeful warp-echo of the Archon he betrayed never gets loose. When the Explorers \naccidentally rouse the spirit of Zaergarn later in the \nchapter, Drecarus immediately becomes aware of their \ninﬁltration. The GM should not reveal any of these \nfacts to the Explorers until the end of the ﬁrst chapter, but should keep them in mind, and might wish to use this information to seed hints throughout the story."

The Splintered Talon never allows any vessel not of their Kabal to land or dock anywhere close to the ziggurat. The outskirts of the Nexus, however, are largely unregulated, the rulers of the Nexus apparently not deigning to take a hand in such matters. Barring those that are openly hostile, there are few ships that cannot ﬁnd a place to dock at the Nexus. Unlike an Imperial port, there are no ofﬁcial protocols or station masters waiting to meet the Explorers when they arrive, demanding their business or looking for \ncoin. The sphere also has no atmosphere, so the Explorers can \nbring their vessel as close as they dare, though it is probably \nbe more practical to set their vessel into a low geosynchronous orbit and make their landing in their lighter.\nOnce they have arrived, Salaine Morn and her warriors (a \ncadre of eight Kabalite Warriors, whose proﬁle can be found on page 122) depart to complete their own goals but leave the Explorers with a means of contacting them and can come to their aid (within the city) if needed or at the GM’s discretion. The Explorers might also encounter some of the factions of the Nexus of Shadows as soon as they arrive (see Denizens \nof the Nexus on page 11), depending on how careful they are about making their landing. The Explorers can then choose how they want to reach the palace and set the charges. The GM can use the guidelines presented below to guide the efforts of the PCs, using any or all of the encounters as he sees ﬁt, or even using some of the encounters from the other approaches if they seem appropriate.\nIn this section, the Explorers should experience the Nexus, \nmeet some of the minor factions (or at least become aware of \nthem), and then make their way to the Archon’s palace. This \nsection can be as long or short as the GM and players desire, though the danger and lawlessness of the Nexus of Shadows should be plain for the Explorers to see, especially if they must travel through the Shadowed Arteries. Before running this section, the GM should take some time to become familiar with Gazetteer: The Nexus of Shadows on page 9. The \nGM should feel free to use encounters from the list provided on Table 0–1: Nexus of Shadows Encounters on page 21 \nduring this and any other trip across the city.\nTHIEVES IN THE NIGHT\nPerhaps the easiest way to reach the Archon’s palace, and the method recommended by Salaine, is to use stealth, attempting to pass through the city or through the outlands undetected. While this does not present the same dangers as going in guns blazing or trying to bluff an audience with a ranking member of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, it means sticking to out of the way regions and places like the Shadow Arteries that bring their own perils to the traveller. Like any city, the Nexus \nis a nest of rumours and lies, with spies and information \nbrokers on every street, so passing unnoticed might prove more challenging than the Explorers anticipate, and they may be required to do more than simply keep to the shadows.If the PCs elect to use stealth at any point to try reaching \nthe Archon’s palace, the GM can use any or all of these encounters along the way to challenge them in addition to some encounters from Table 0–1 Nexus of Shadows \nEncounters on page 21. Presumably, the Kabal of the Splintered Talon is not actively looking for them, and travellers come and go from the Nexus every day, so unless \nthey make a great show of their arrival, or their ship is \nparticularly remarkable or well known, the Explorers should \nbe able to make a landing anywhere in the Shadowed \nArteries or outlands without arousing suspicions.\nENEMIES  OF M Y ENEMIES\nThe Explorers are not the only ones interested in The Soul \nReaver , and both the Consorvana Ring and the Cult of the \nFalse Dawn are aware of its existence and eager to pillage \nit, though for very different reasons. New arrivals are always noticed by certain elements of the Nexus, and when the Explorers make their landing, informants will convey this news to both of the factions. The Consorvana Ring is interested in the Explorers initially because they are traders. Of course, if they ﬁnd out that the Explorers are interested in \nThe Soul Reaver and ﬁnding an entrance to the ziggurat, they \nwill see this as an opportunity to ﬁnally lay their hands on \nthe Archon’s valuable xenos artefacts. The Cult of the False Dawn has long coveted The Soul Reaver and its \nstore of souls as a sacriﬁce to their dark god, but have never been able to gain entrance to the"

When they become aware of the presence of the Explorers, they see it as a sign from the Keeper of Secrets that their chance has arrived, and try to forge an alliance with the \nExplorers and use them so that they might have a chance to \ntake The  Soul Reaver for themselves.\nThe GM can use either or both of these factions to \ncomplicate things and offer support to the Explorers. Shortly \nafter their arrival, agents of both factions approach them in the \nShadow Arteries, offering assistance or promising a chance at \nproﬁt if they think wealth will sway the Explorers. If Salaine is with the Explorers, she is aware of the Consorvana Ring (they were a substantial presence in the city during her rule) and tells the Explorers to deal with them if they wish, since they have no love for the Archon and might prove useful. She does not know anything of the Cult of the False Dawn, though she can sense the taint of Chaos on them, even if the Explorers cannot, and advises them to be cautious when dealing with any who follow the Dark Gods. The GM should allow the Explorers to choose how to deal with both factions, and these groups monitor the Explorers once they are on the Nexus, looking for a chance to use the PCs’ presence to their own advantage. While the Cult of the False Dawn does not betray the presence of the Explorers to the Archon, fearing the wrath of the Dark \nEldar should they draw the ruling Kabal’s notice, the agents of \nthe Consorvana Ring are not so choosy. However, they have no formal alliance with the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, and might well pass information on to him should it get them closer to ransacking The  Soul Reaver for artefacts. \nDetails of the Consorvana Ring and the Cult of the False \nDawn, their leaders and goals, as well guidelines on how to use them, can be found in the Lesser Factions section on page 12.\nPREDATOR  AND PREY\nWhile Drecarus himself is not personally aware of the presence of the Explorers, their arrival and actions in the city being beneath his concern, there are those that might regard the PCs’ demise as a favour to their master. The landing of the Explorers is likely to be noticed, no matter how careful the PCs are. Sensors detect the Explorers’ ship and keen minds make connections as to why a Rogue Trader might come to the Nexus, and what old powers he might be in league with. One such mind is that of Ravyr Dysk, a Dark Eldar noble once allied to Salaine but now ﬁrmly on the side of Zaergarn (and thus Drecarus by default, even though he is unaware of \nhis Archon’s untimely replacement). Always eager to curry \nfavour with his master, and to wipe away the stain of any past associations with Salaine, Ravyr has become a cruel and cunning opportunist. The arrival of the Explorers prompts him to action and he makes a habit of seeking them out soon after their arrival. Though not as wealthy or powerful as many of the other nobles of the Bonespires, Ravyr \ndoes have his means and uses them to make \nthe Explorers’ mission more difﬁcult. \nThe Explorers have already \naroused Ravyr’s suspicions, and should have to succeed on at least a Hard (–20) Charm \nor Deceive Test to convince him that they are not afﬁliated with Salaine Morn (obviously, if he encounters them with Salaine, this Test should be considerably harder).\nIf Ravyr comes away from his encounter with the Explorers \nwith a positive outlook on the group, he invites them to join him at one of the soirees held by the nobles of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon in the Deathworld Gardens (see Banquet \nof Pain on page 41). If they decline, or if he develops an unfavourable impression of the Explorers for another reason, \nRavyr decides to claim their heads for his Archon and ask \nquestions later, if at all. To this end, he employs a particularly ill-tempered and modiﬁed Ariadne Helspider that he calls \nFleshﬂayer. Bought at signiﬁcant expense from the Cult of the \nWithered Blade, Fleshﬂayer is a cunning killer, and has been \noutﬁtted with an experimental device created by the insane \nscience of The Sutured Helix that compels it to doggedly hunt certain individuals. Not just a horror in combat, with the strength to pierce carapace armour like paper or the speed to dodge bullets, the beast is also an excellent tracker and extremely stealthy for its size. Ravyr unleashes it into the Nexus to hunt down the Explorers, planting their psychic signature in its mind before setting it to its task. The beast then vanishes into the city, descending down into the Shadow Arteries and the sub-levels to seek out the Explorers and complete its master’s wishes. At the direction of Ravyr, this shall be no quick kill, though, as gathering the lives of the Explorers is only part of his gift to the Archon, and he wishes \nthe beast to toy with the these victims ﬁrst, causing them \npain, running them to ground, and terrifying them before ﬁnally moving in for the deathblow.\nThe GM can use the beast to dog the Explorers’ journey from \ntheir landing to the ziggurat, and even into the palace’s chambers if they have not resolved the game of cat and mouse by then. Initially the beast (which uses the proﬁle for an Ariadne Helspider, found on page 133, but with a +30 bonus to Weapon Skill, Toughness, and Strength, and an additional 20 Wounds) will only strike once and then retreat, picking on lone Explorers or those who have strayed from the group, trying to inﬂict wounds with a sudden bite before vanishing as quickly as it arrived. The beast is both exceptionally swift and stealthy, and does its best to fade after striking. The presence of the beast is more to disrupt the Explorers’ plans rather than pose a signiﬁcant danger to them, forcing them to travel more slowly or try to hunt it down before it strikes again. To this end, the GM should use the beast largely \nin the background, its skittering gait heard from afar, its shadow \nglimpsed at the end of the tunnels before quickly vanishing, and its large webs blocking potential routes forward. Only if the Explorers have been seriously wounded ﬁghting the Dark Eldar or some of the other denizens of the Nexus should the beast pose a real threat, attacking as they try to reach safety.\nA t \nto action and he makes a habit of seeking them out soon after \ntheir arrival.

Ravyr continues to take an interest in the Explorers, and might try other ways of bringing them to his master should the beast fail.\nTHE PATH UNTREAD\nThe ziggurat lies at the centre of the Nexus of Shadows, and the city sprawls out around it. This means that the most direct route to reach the ziggurat is to pass through the city, either travelling the Shadowed Arteries or the high gantries and walkways of the Bonespires, since approach from the air is \npractically impossible given the Razor’s Web. The only other \nway to reach the ziggurat and remain undetected is to come from beneath, using the deep sub-levels that descend in a \nseemingly endless sprawl below the Shadow Arteries. While \nthe Shadow Arteries go deep below the surface of the sphere, \nthey only scratch the surface of the sub-levels, tunnels, and \nchambers reaching down for kilometres before reaching the fusion core and the great void in the centre of the artiﬁcial world. If the Explorers choose, they can try to ﬁnd a way through the maze of tunnels below the city and then ﬁnd a way back up again where it meets the ziggurat. This is not an easy task, as most of the tunnels leading down into the sphere have been sealed up by the Dark Eldar to limit the places that escaped slaves and other fugitives can hide, and to protect against the dangers of the sphere’s ancient defences which might still send esoteric machines up from the depths. Thus, to ﬁnd a path, the Explorers need to ﬁnd a way in, survive the machines, predators, and defences of the deep levels, then \nﬁnd a way out again, ideally somewhere under the ziggurat.\nFinding a way in either requires a signiﬁcant amount of \nsearching (an undertaking which Salaine may well advise \nagainst given the time sensitivity of their mission) or the favour of a faction that can lead them to one. This favour can be gained in a number of ways, as each faction has its own agenda and goals, some asking for thrones and others after service or secrets. Whichever group they choose to visit, there are consequences, as some groups are happy to keep the Explorers secret while others might immediately sell the information about their intentions to the Dark Eldar (see Lesser Factions on page 12 for details on the various \nfactions of the Nexus and their agendas). An alternative to getting access to the sub-levels below the city from a faction is to make a landing outside the edges of the city and enter the sphere from there. If the Explorers do want to take this path, then it is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd their way to the ziggurat, since \nthey are starting so far away and must navigate kilometres of \ntunnels and chambers to even ﬁnd a way below the city. To begin this journey through the depths below, the Explorers must succeed at a Hard (–20) Navigation (Surface) Test to ﬁnd their way down into the sub-levels. If any of the Explorers are intimately familiar with the Nexus of Shadows, or the Explorers can ﬁnd a local NPC to guide them, they gain a +30 bonus on this Test.\nOnce the Explorers enter the sub-levels of the Nexus of \nShadows, they then need to make their way to below the ziggurat. The GM can use encounters from Table 0–1 Nexus \nof Shadows Encounters on page 21 as well as details from the Nexus of Shadows gazetteer to create challenges for their journey. The time the PCs spend trying to ﬁnd their way through the maze of tunnels also provides a good opportunity \nfor any factions or enemies wishing to ambush the Explorers \nto make their move, far from any aid from above. The \ngreatest danger in the sub-levels is getting lost, and unless the Explorers take great pains to plot a course, bringing with them a powerful auspex (the kind that requires servitors to \ncarry) or tap into the sphere’s ancient systems to ﬁnd maps, \nthe individual scouting out the Explorers’ twisted path must make a Very Hard (–30) Navigation (Surface) Skill Test. If the pathﬁnder passes this test, roll on Table 0–1 Nexus \nof Shadows Encounters and resolve the encounter before the Explorers reach the base of the ziggurat. If he fails, roll on Table 0–1 Nexus of Shadows Encounters and, after \nresolving the encounter, the GM should inform the Explorers that they are lost in the nest of tunnels for several hours before repeating the process, inserting any other appropriate challenges in the interim.\nMACROCANNONS SPEAK \nLOUDER THAN WORDS\nIt is possible, and likely for some groups, that the Explorers \nmight resort to force to reach the palace, blasting their way through opposition and blazing a path across the city before smashing down the Archon’s door. Salaine strongly advises against a serious frontal assault, for after all, if her ﬂeet was smashed by the Razor’s Web, what chance would the Explorers’ lone vessel have? Still, she accepts that a certain \nlevel of force could be used without attracting undue attention \n(at least until it is too late for the defenders to do anything \nabout it). Provided the Explorers do not start an open war, \nand if they are clever about where and when they strike, they \ncould get away with forcing their way to the palace gates.\nIf the Explorers choose to use some amount of overt \nforce at any point to reach the palace (such as killing any Dark Eldar patrols they encounter in open environments, or without efforts to conceal the combat or its messy results) the GM can use any or all of the encounters set out below to handle the escalation of violence. Only serious attacks on the Nexus draw the Kabal’s direct attention, and ﬁghting in the Shadowed Arteries and the Bonespires does not prompt a direct reaction from the Splintered Talon unless it spills over into the arenas or ziggurat. In fact, the nobles of the Bonespires routinely ﬁght each other and often use mercenaries to make raids on other towers. That said, attacks by voidships will obviously draw notice and a more direct reprisal, as lances \nand macrobatteries pose a danger to the whole city and, more \nimportantly, the palace housing the Kabal of the Splintered \nTalon and The Soul Reaver. If ever the Explorers’ vessel (or any \nother ship) draws the ﬁre of the Razor’s Web, it must dodge \nﬁre from the towers (see The Razor’s Web on page 39)."

      "text": "38\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nI: The Queen of Shadows\nARMED  RESPONSE\nIf the Explorers start throwing their weight around and using \nsubstantial ﬁrepower to deal with their problems, they might eventually draw a response from the Dark Eldar, especially if they kill one or more Dark Eldar patrols without taking appropriate and successful steps to conceal what transpired. While a certain amount of damage is acceptable, especially against the other inhabitants of the Nexus or in the depths of the Shadow Arteries, both the Cult of the Withered Blade and the Kabal of the Splintered Talon have little tolerance for assaults against their warriors and domains. A simple way to chart this rise in response \nfrom the Dark Eldar is for the GM to roll for encounters twice \nas frequently than he normally would (see Table 0–1: Nexus \nof Shadows Encounters on page 21 for guidelines on creating random encounters for the Explorers throughout this chapter).\nIn addition to the increased chance of encountering hostile \nDark Eldar hunting for the culprits who have slain their brethren, the GM can have the Dark Eldar lay an ambush for the Explorers. After two or more patrols from the Cult of the Withered Blade or the Kabal of the Splintered Thorn vanish or turn up dead, the Dark Eldar begin to seek out those responsible. Over time, Information trickles back to the Dark Eldar unless the PCs are very diligent at covering their tracks (avoiding contact with any of the denizens of the Nexus, keeping to disused areas or the sub-levels, cleaning up bodies after combats, and taking other precautionary measures). This ambush can occur anywhere, but should involve at least three times as many Kabalite Warriors or Wyches (depending on which organisation decides to respond) as there are Explorers (see pages 122 and 124 for the proﬁle for Kabalite Warriors and Withered Blade Wyches). If the Explorers are especially \nskilled (Rank 5 or above), have brought a substantial retinue \nwith them, or are very well equipped (armed with a considerable amount of heavy weapons and ordinance), the GM should make the ambushers into Splintered Talon Trueborn Warriors or Hekatrix Bloodbrides (see pages 123-124 for the proﬁle for Kabalite Trueborn and Hekatrix Bloodbrides). The ambushing force of Dark Eldar choose their ground carefully, blocking off exits and setting up a crossﬁre or pincer manoeuvre with positions on either side of the Explorers.\nIf the Explorers are defeated in this or any other encounter \nwith a Dark Eldar patrol, the Dark Eldar need not kill them, but should instead drag them before Drecarus for a brief questioning and a chance for the Explorers—and the players—to learn that the Haemonculus is now secretly the true lord of the Nexus. After this encounter, the GM can advance the plot to A Dark \nTwist of Fate on page 44. If they slay the Dark Eldar or escape \nthe trap, then every Dark Eldar patrol that they encounter is extremely suspicious of them by default, and they will be hunted mercilessly all the way into the heart of the ziggurat.\nUNEXPECTED  ALLIES\nThere are those within the Nexus who have no love for the Dark Eldar, and some who openly revile the aliens for their dark ways and callous natures. During a combat encounter with the Dark Eldar, one of these factions could come to the aid of the Explorers, or use it as an excuse to try to form an alliance with them. The GM can use this as an opening for factions like the Consorvana Ring or the Cult of the False Dawn, as detailed in the Enemies of My Enemies section on \npage 35, or to introduce other new allies and NPCs. Everyone in the Nexus has an agenda, and naivety is short-lived in the \ndark and twisted city, so anyone who does aid the Explorers \nwill do so for their own ends. A list of the Lesser Factions and \ntheir goals and ambitions can be found on page 12. Any one of these groups could become embroiled with the Explorers’ plans to try to further their own agendas. If Salaine is with the Explorers, she takes a keen interest in any allies who might help with the coming attack, weakening the position of her enemies and paving the way for her return to power.\nThe GM can use this encounter if the Explorers are having \ndifﬁculty with a combat encounter or if their group is not made up of especially combat-oriented characters, giving them a source of NPCs to help them defeat any Dark Eldar they might encounter while trying to enter the ziggurat. If the GM wants, he could even have some of the gladiatorial NPCs who feature in Chapter II: Blood, Steel, and Sand join the \nPCs at this point, allowing the Explorers to get to know them before they are taken into slavery, and making alliances easier \nlater on when plans of escape are formulated. While the aid \nof a faction or NPC within the Nexus helps them directly in this ﬁrst chapter, such allies may prove a far greater boon to the PCs later on in the adventure when they are cut off from their vessel and their crew and must rely only on those within the Nexus for support. Unless the PCs go out of their way to avoid contact with the inhabitants of the Nexus, the GM should at least offer them the chance to gain the favour of a faction or make a temporary pact with those they meet. If neither of the factions detailed in the Enemy of My Enemies  \nsection on page 35 is one with which the Explorers can suffer to ally themselves, remember that the Nexus is ﬁlled with those looking for an opportunity to get ahead, at any cost, \nKICKING  IN THE DOOR\nThe main gate of the ziggurat is a massive ediﬁce accessible from the Shadow Arteries, just below the surface of the Gaelan Sphere. Though it is rarely used by the forces of the Kabal (who prefer to ﬂy from spire to spire instead of deigning to soil their feet on the surface), it is guarded by no less than four gun emplacements, each with six Splintered Talon Kabalite Trueborn equipped with heavy weapons (see page 123 for the proﬁle for Kabalite \nTrueborn). These nests overlook a ﬂat courtyard, largely \ndevoid of cover. On top of that, the door is multi-layered, \nand each of the three layers must be destroyed or breached \nindividually (with a Challenging (+0) Demolition \nTest and appropriate equipment, or some other cleverness \non the part of the Explorers). A group of ﬁve Grotesques is kept chained behind the doors to stymie any intruders (see page 127 for the proﬁle for Grotesques). Finally, every 5 Rounds after the Explorers begin their assault, a Raider carrying 10 Kabalite Trueborn arrives from the garrisons to defend the entrance or expunge any intruders (see page 138 for the proﬁle for Raiders). These warriors pursue the intruders into the fortress, abandoning their transports as necessary to chase the Explorers through the fortress."

Just as Salaine should always appear a moment away from betrayal, the GM should give the players plenty of leeway to theorise about the chance that the Explorers might be betrayed at any moment by those around them. He can even foster such ideas if the Explorers ﬁnd themselves using the support of multiple factions or are seeking information concerning Salaine from \nthe denizens of the Nexus, each one warning them about the \nuntrustworthiness of the others. In essence the introduction of allies, whether they come to the Explorers’ aid in a ﬁre-ﬁght or meet them during their journey to The  Soul Reaver, is \nan excellent opportunity for the GM to reveal new directions or options within the plot as required, nudging the Explorers in interesting directions or offering them an alternative path should they ﬁnd themselves stuck on a particular challenge. \nFULL FRONTAL  CHARGE\nA direct assault on Zaergarn Kul’s ziggurat is almost certainly doomed to failure, at least from the air, where the power of the Razor’s Web will quickly disable or destroy the Explorers’ vessel. On top of the Razor’s Web, the Archon’s palace is always guarded by a pair of Torture-class cruisers (see page 137 for the proﬁle for this vessel). The GM can use Salaine Morn and other NPCs to advise the Explorers about the slim chance of success of an aerial attack, and perhaps more importantly, the massive risk it poses to their most valuable possession—their voidship.\nA slightly more feasible plan involves assaulting the \npalace on foot, disabling the Razor’s Web, and then calling \nin a ship to rip out The Soul Reaver before the full might \nof the Kabal of the Splintered Talon can descend upon the \nattackers. While Salaine does not believe that brute force can crack this particular puzzle, and seeks to dissuade the Explorers from anything so foolhardy, it is still possible for them to try. If the Explorers can secure a landing somewhere in the city, perhaps as close as a few kilometres to the ziggurat, with a force at their backs, they can attempt to punch through the palace’s considerable ground defences. Any obvious build-up of men and weapons draws the ire of the Kabal.\nIf the Explorers land with a lightning strike force of \nonly a few elite troops, foregoing heavy weapons, tanks, and artillery, they can make it to the ziggurat largely unopposed. A smaller force like this can also move quickly enough that the Archon’s spies and scouts might not \nnotice its landing, and within the space of a few hours \nthe Explorers could be launching their attack. Salaine does not take part in such an attack, though she does not stop the Explorers if they insist on such a course, and remains in the city to see its outcome and use it to her advantage. The focus of the battle should be on blasting open the main pressure doors which lead into the ziggurat’s lower levels, and the GM should have the entrance guarded by a cadre of the Archon’s ﬁnest Kabalite Trueborn.\nIf the Explorers defeat the forces defending the gate, they \nare then forced to engage in a running battle to reach The Soul Reaver as the Archon’s forces gather strength and more and more warriors ﬂood in from every direction. During this dash for The Soul Reaver, the GM can also use encounters from \nFortress of Blood and Shadow as the Explorers blunder into traps and patrols along the way (see page 42). Haemonculus Drecarus, the Arch-Agonist of T’saevoym and master of the \nSutured Helix, heads the defence of the ziggurat and unleashes \nevery creature at his disposal to stop the Explorers’ progress.\nLORDS OF THE EXPANSE\nThe Explorers can always try to reach the palace using \ntheir cunning and guile, talking their way into the areas \nof the city controlled by the Dark Eldar and petitioning for \nan audience with the Archon. Dark Eldar do not respect the \nWarrant of Trade as the Imperium does, nor do they recognise the rights of a Rogue Trader, and so the Explorers need to prove they are powerful individuals worthy of the aliens’ time and attention before they are given leave to enter the palace. \nEven then, they will be under guard most of the time, and may \neven be asked to relinquish their weapons when entering the \nziggurat. With a skilled tongue and brazen conﬁdence, the \nExplorers can use this tactic to get all the way to The  Soul \nReaver , though it is likely at some point they must resort to \nstealth or force to achieve their true goals.\nIf the PCs choose to try talking their way past the Dark \nEldar to get into the palace at any point, the GM can use \nany or all of these encounters. Even if they announce \nthemselves on arrival as grand and glorious Rogue \nTraders, Drecarus will not immediately take an interest in \nthem (it takes a great deal to pull the Haemonculus away \nfrom his foul “artistic expression”). Instead, they have to \nearn the favour of a noble before they are invited into the \npalace, which means dipping their toes in the fetid pool that is Dark Eldar politics. A grand ship and a proﬁtable cargo, though, can get them started along this path.\nTHE RAZOR □S W EB\nThe Razor’s Web is an extremely dangerous defensive network of ordinance weapons capable of stripping voidships from low orbit and annihilating anything that ﬂies in the city without the Archon’s permission. Fighting the Razor’s Web is impractical—for each \nmacrocannon a voidship can demolish, three more \nbristle from the spires of the Dark Eldar city and the ancient surface of the Gaelan Sphere. For each Strategic Round that a vessel is targeted by the Razor’s \nWeb, its pilot must make an Arduous (–40) Pilot \n(Space Craft)+Manoeuvrability Test . For every \nDegree of Failure on each Test, the ship suffers one \nhit from the Razor’s Web, which uses the proﬁle for a Disintegrator Macrocannon Cluster as described in Chapter IV: The Treacherous Path on page 137. These hits count as having a number of Degrees of Success equal to the Degrees of Failure from the Pilot (Space Craft)+Manoeuvrability Test.\n before the full might \nof the Kabal of the Splintered Talon can descend upon the \nattackers.

While some of the Dark Eldar the Explorers encounter should be willing to make trade deals with them or accept their coin, most see these alien outsiders and their ship as another pawn in the endless struggle for control of the Nexus and its wealth. Zaergarn has been oddly reclusive for some years, and some within the Kabal of the Splintered Talon who believe this heralds the time for a new Archon—though they dare not speak such treachery in the presence of Drecarus, \nwho hands down many of Zaergarn’s decrees. This event can \noccur either once the Explorers have made their introductions \nwith the Dark Eldar or after they have started making deals or traded slaves or other goods, services, and secrets. The GM should have a Dark Eldar noble approach the Explorers, \nespecially if he has learned of their interest in obtaining an \naudience with an ofﬁcial inside of the Archon’s palace, and make them an offer. This might be Ravyr Dysk, or another, similar oligarch in the Kabal of the Splintered Talon (see page 36 for more information on Ravyr Dysk). In exchange for his favour and a word in the right ear, he wants the Explorers to dispatch one of his rivals, another Dark Eldar captain with a fortress in the Bonespires. He does not care how they complete their task, only that his enemy dies, opening the way for his own forces to take over the noble’s holdings.\nThe GM can make the completion of this favour as simple \nor as complicated as he chooses, depending on the skills the Explorers possess and how difﬁcult things have been for them \nup to this point. In its most basic form, this means somehow \ngaining entrance into one of the Bonespire towers and then \nslaying the lord and most of his personal guard. The Bonespires \nare guarded, but not by soldiers as elite or dangerous as those who defend the Archon’s palace. To reach their target, the Explorers must bluff or sneak their way past no less than two groups of ten Kabalite Warriors in the spire unless they can ﬁnd a pretence to meet with the aristocrat (see page 122 for the proﬁle for Kabalite Warriors). Dark Eldar lords are very much in tune with the world of deception; words in the right ear and knives in the right back are the most powerful tools at their disposal, and thus most are paranoid and defended by skilled warriors at all times. Except in special circumstances, a Dark Eldar noble is always guarded by at least ﬁve Kabalite Trueborn (see page 123 for the proﬁle for Kabalite Trueborn, which can also be used for any Dark Eldar noble in question).\nThis simple assassination can also be used \nby the GM as a lesson in the treacherous nature of the Dark Eldar. Unless they are careful and ﬁnd a concrete way to guarantee that the noble who hired them upholds his end of the bargain, he at the very least attempts to extort them for another favour of some sort even if they kill the target, and may even expose the crime that he incited to Drecarus or another great lord for his own beneﬁt. Clever Explorers can protect themselves against this situation by bringing in a third party, seeking out the favour of other nobles with vested interests in the Bonespires, or keeping proof of the Dark Eldar’s subterfuge. If the Explorers succeed and also manage to keep their noble contact true to his word, they take one step closer to winning an audience \nwith the Archon—if they fail and are captured, or are \nbetrayed and brought before the Archon, GM can take this \nopportunity to advance the plot to A Dark Twist of Fate  \non page 44 if he so chooses.\nBANQUET  OF PAIN\nOnce the Explorers have made some inroads into their dealings with the Dark Eldar, either by currying favour with the nobles of the Bonespires or bringing trade to increase the wealth of the city, word of their presence reaches the aristocrats and individuals of rank within the Kabal of the Splintered Talon. Given their Archon’s reclusive ways, these lords and ladies have taken to hosting elaborate events on their own, at which they can scheme, deal, and betray, all while taking in the suffering of their slaves and their rivals alike. The Explorers have been invited to an event in the Deathworld Gardens atop the ziggurat and is a \ngrand affair involving numerous Dark Eldar nobles as well as any \nother powerful individuals from the city who the GM wishes to be in attendance (especially those who might already have ties to the PCs or the lesser factions). Each noble hopes to use the Explorers to his or her own ends, and can do this in a number of ways, including slipping the Explorers secrets or advice that might lead them into conﬂict with a rival.\nThe encounter begins with a meal, but after it concludes, \nthe true feast of suffering begins. The nobles make their way over to the balcony overlooking the gardens and begin the evening’s entertainment. Tokens have been hidden throughout the garden and slaves are sent in to ﬁnd them. Each Dark Eldar noble has provided a slave, and the one whose slave can ﬁnd the most tokens before the plants kill them all is the winner. The Explorers are invited to join in the contest, though they \nmust offer up their own slaves or retainers. If they play the \ngame, the nobles are suitably impressed, and may deem the Explorers worthy pawns in their labyrinthine schemes against one another, entrusting them with secrets that they hope may bring about the downfall of their rivals in the deadly court. The Explorers can gain extra favour by winning the game (even weighting the odds in their favour by sneaking their retainer a \nweapon or auspex to assist him in the gardens, using \npsychic powers to help him survive, or coming up \nwith some other subtle method of offering their \naid). The Explorers can try to talk their way out \nof putting up one of their own for this task, but \nit should require a suitably good reason \nbacked by a successful Ordinary (+10) \nCharm, Blather or Deceive Skill Test  \nto convince their hosts that their reasons \nare not mere sentimentality, loyalty, \nor softheartedness.

The Explorers must \noffer a compelling reason and make a Hard (–20) Charm or \nDeceive Test to convince an NPC such as Ravyr Dysk, if he \nis present (and not openly hostile to them) to let them into the \nDeathworld Gardens, though they receive a +20 bonus on this \nTest if they have managed to ﬁt in with the moral degenerates at the party, and have not drawn undue attention to themselves or balked at the obscene cruelty of their Dark Eldar hosts. In either case, see Garden of Death section on page 42-43 for details on \nnavigating this perilous greenhouse.\nFORTRESS  OF BLOOD  AND SHADOW\nWhether they walk through the grand front gates of Zaergarn’s ziggurat or skulk in through the under-tunnels, the Explorers become aware of the transition from the city as soon as they cross the threshold into the spires of the palace. Tarnished walls of ancient steel and stone are replaced with curved alien arches and strangely asymmetrical corridors. Everywhere, twisted runes and protruding blades add to the \nsense of danger and disquiet. The ziggurat is divided into \nthree areas: the outer tunnels and chambers, the towers and spires, and the inner core where The Soul Reaver is housed. \nTo reach The  Soul Reaver and gain entrance to the ancient \nship, the Explorers must navigate one or both of the outer regions, making it past patrols and Zaergarn’s lieutenants. The method by which they make their way to the ziggurat inﬂuences how they proceed and whether or not they ﬁght their way through, sneak past guards or claim to have an audience with Zaergarn (whether or not they actually do). The GM can use the Table 0–1: Nexus of Shadows \nEncounters on page 21 to generate random encounters as the Explorers make their way to The Soul Reaver, forcing them \nto deal with the various perils and obstacle in their path. In addition to these random encounters, there are two other encounters the GM can use depending on how the Explorers try to enter the ziggurat, either from below (using the city or \nthe sub-levels) or from above (using the walkways from the \nBonespires or arriving by air, invited or otherwise). \nLABYRINTH  OF PAIN\nThe outer chambers of the ziggurat have been extensively modiﬁed by the Dark Eldar and bear little resemblance to their original design, the xenos covering the walls with dark steel and twisted architecture. In addition to the chance of the PCs encountering Dark Eldar patrols or slaves who might give away their presence, whole sections of these outer regions have been \nturned into madness-mazes and pain-traps. The GM can use \nboth of these obstacles to make it harder for the Explorers \nto reach The Soul Reaver, especially if they are moving \nwith haste and blunder into them while making \nreckless progress towards their goal.Madness-Mazes\nDark Eldar enjoy tormenting the weak minds of aliens as much as they enjoy torturing their ﬂesh, and the madness-mazes are a prime example of this. They consist of a series of corridors and chambers that have been modiﬁed using false turns and hidden passages along with dangerous and disturbing imagery that is painful to look upon. A slave or intruder wandering into such a maze can become easily confused by the twisting walls and ﬂoors, his eyes tricking him into wandering into razor-sharp protrusions while he fails to spot places where a door or passage to safety is concealed by a curve of the wall, invisible from all but a certain angle. In this way, it is possible to wander for hours in such a place, walking in a circle through the same rooms again and again. If the Explorers wander into a madness-maze, they will need to make a Very Hard (–30) Intelligence Test to escape, unless \nthey can devise a plan to circumvent the maze (such as cutting \nthrough its walls or using technology to overcome it–servitors and other mechanical entities, for instance, are not as affected by the mental tricks of such a maze). Failure means at least another half an hour of wandering before a Test can be made again, and an Insanity Point for each member of the group as the Dark Eldar architecture wears away at their minds. Failing by more than three degrees of failure means that one Explorer, chosen at random, has suffered physical harm from a spiked wall, hidden razor-wire, or other suitably dreadful hazard, and must make a Hard (–20) Toughness Test or suffer 1d5 \nDamage that is not reduced by Toughness or Armour.\nPain-Traps\nPain-traps are another cruel addition to the ziggurat by the Dark Eldar, and can be found almost anywhere, especially in places where slaves must work, as the aliens enjoy watching their chattels stumble into them, and they drink in the constant fear such traps instil. The traps are usually disguised as normal sections of ﬂoor or wall, though they can also be incorporated into furniture or doors, the only tell-tale sign of their presence a ﬁne web of silver visible on close inspection (requiring a Difﬁcult (–10) Awareness or Search Test to ﬁnd and a \nChallenging (+0) Security Test to disable). When touched, \nthe pain-trap activates, sending impulses into the subject’s \nbrain that makes him spasm in agony. The effects of a pain-trap require a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test to resist, with \nfailure inﬂicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The pain-trap works through armour and clothing, though the affected Explorer gains a +10 bonus to the Toughness Test for every 5 Armour Points (rounding down) on the location touching the trap. Apart from being extremely unpleasant, an Explorer affected by a pain trap screams out in agony unless he stiﬂes himself (which could be important if the Explorers are trying to sneak into The Soul Reaver). A character may resist the urge to scream \nby passing an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test. \nGARDEN  OF DEATH\nThe upper reaches of the ziggurat are crowned with towers and defensive platforms, which host a number of Dark Eldar garrisons and also act as a playground for those most favoured by the Archon. While the Explorers are unlikely to come here unless"

If the Explorers can reach this platform, either by stealth using the covered gantries that connect \nmany of the towers atop the palace or by invitation to witness one \nof the terrible events that takes place there, they can try to enter \nthe gardens and ﬁnd the hidden entrance.\nThe Deathworld Gardens live up to their name. They \ncontain a collection of the most aggressive ﬂora that the Dark Eldar can ﬁnd, gathered from across the Koronus Expanse \nand beyond. To descend into the garden, the Explorers must breach the repression ﬁeld which covers it (protecting spectators from its dangers), which requires a key unless they have somehow talked their way into entering the garden. Each members of the Spire Guard possesses a copy of the key. This cadre of Kabalite Trueborn is dedicated to protecting the Deathworld Gardens because of the entrance to The  Soul \nReaver there, and is equal in number to the Explorers plus one \nextra Kabalite Trueborn for each Explorer Rank 5 or higher (see page 123 for the Kabalite Trueborn proﬁle). These guards are scattered throughout the balconies that hang over the Deathworld Gardens, but report remotely to each other every 1d5 minutes. Alternatively, the GM can allow the PCs to make a Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use Test to bypass the \nDark Eldar gate-locks (the Test is reduced to a Challenging \n(+0) Tech-Use Test if the Explorer attempting it is intimately familiar with Dark Eldar technology or is a Dark Eldar himself ). Failure sets off alarms, prompting a swift reaction from the Spire Guard, as well as a pair of Grotesques that \nnormally sit inactive on the balconies, \nreminders that Drecarus dislikes \nbeing called away \nfrom his experiments to resolve matters of \ninternal politics in \nthe Archon’s name \n(see page 127 for \nthe Grotesque \nproﬁle). Once \ninside the garden, \nvisibility drops to \na bare minimum as \nthe plants close in, the \nair becomes humid, and insects crawl and ﬂy everywhere. The GM can treat the \ngarden as a single dynamic challenge that must be overcome \nfor the Explorers to ﬁnd a way through. In this case, each Round that the Explorers are in the garden, each one should make a Challenging (+0) Awareness, Search, or Survival \nTest to see if he can navigate its dangers. Any Explorers who fail this Test suffer 1d10+6 Rending Damage from aggressive and toxic plants, fungi, and insects that become hostile or predatory to the interlopers. Once the party has accrued a cumulative number of Degrees of Success on the Awareness, Search, or Survival Tests equal to twice the \nnumber of Explorers, they discover the secret entrance to The \nSoul Reaver and escape the deadly garden. \nIf the GM does not feel that this is enough of a challenge, he \ncan also add speciﬁc plants to attack the Explorers or use those already detailed in other R\nOGUE TRADER  supplements such as \nTHE KORONUS  BESTIARY . The greenhouse contains a vast number \nof plants, and so the Explorers might run across any suitably horrible ﬂora from the Koronus Expanse and even possibly beyond. After the Explorers depart the Deathworld Gardens through the hidden shaft, they can descend into the ziggurat and climb down to the chamber that contains their target—The  Soul Reaver.\nA L ONG  W AY DOWN\nTo enter by stealth, the Explorers must ﬁrst ﬁnd a way into one of the adjacent towers then make their way past 1d5 patrolling wings of Scourges, who ﬂit around the Archon’s palace, watching all those who cross the thin bridges hanging in the space between spires. In these patrols, there is one Scourge per Explorer, plus one extra Scourge for each Explorer Rank 5 or higher \n(see page 126 for the proﬁle for Scourges). Once they \nhave bargained, bluffed, or fought their way past these \nfeathered guardians, the Explorers must climb down to \nthe Deathworld Gardens. This requires a Hard (–20) \nClimb Test  for each Explorer. If the Explorers are \nwearing proper climbing equipment, failing the Test merely means discovery by another patrol of Scourges, with an extra Scourge for each Explorer who fails the Test.

The GM can read or paraphrase the following when they at last reach the core of the palace:\nLike a blade thrust into the heart of the ziggurat, The Soul Reaver rises from the darkness below up to the pointed apex of the palace. It ancient alien hull is pitted and scarred from untold aeons drifting in the void, though the smooth lines and curved architecture is unmistakable, even beneath so many ages of corruption and decay. Easily six kilometres in length and several across, the vessel sits cocooned in a web of gantries and supports, several of which lead to rents and open portals in its hull that allow access to the ship. There is also a strange disquiet here, like the subtle murmur of a thousand voices babbling to each other but hidden from sight.\nAll the Explorers feel uncomfortable in the presence of The Soul \nReaver , though those with the Psyniscience Skill should become \nacutely aware of the vessel’s potent psychic aura and the raw \npower rolling off it. From this point, any resistance or Dark \nEldar patrols seem to vanish, and once they step onto The Soul \nReaver  itself, there seem to be no guards at all. This is because \nit is a trap. Unknown to the Explorers, and to almost every inhabitant of the Nexus, Zaergarn has been dead for decades, slain by Salaine’s hired Mandrake, his soul held trapped in The \nSoul Reaver. Drecarus has been controlling the Kabal of the Splintered Talon since the demise of his master, and is one of the few who knows that the tormented spirit of the Archon still lingers. Insane and barely sentient, Zaergarn still whispers to Drecarus, making plots and issuing warnings. Drecarus largely ignores the spirit’s ravings, but he has long studied what he calls the “Reaver Device” that has trapped the Archon’s twisted echo, and has numerous specialised machines that constantly monitor the power output by The  Soul Reaver’s mysterious core.\nThe Explorers must set their charges in three places in the \ninner complex to physically break The  Soul Reaver free, and then \nboard the ship itself to plant a mysterious “severing device” given to them by Salaine Morn that, supposedly, will cut off the power ﬂow from The Soul Reaver to the Razor’s Web.\nTo ﬁnd each site for the three charges, the Explorers must \npass a Challenging (+0) Navigation (Surface) Test. If they fail this Test, they encounter a madness-maze or a pain trap (see Labyrinth of Pain on page 42). Once they have reached the location, the Explorers must pass a Difﬁcult (–10) Demolition \nTest to rig the charge to explode upon a remote command; if they fail this Test, the Explorers spend too long on the preparations, \nand while they do place the explosives properly, the Explorers \nare discovered by a group of Kabalite Warriors equal to their \nparty in number. The Explorers must dispatch these foes \nswiftly and stealthily, lest they attract the attention of \nother Splintered Talon defenders.After placing the charges, the Explorers must take the ﬁnal \nstep and board The Soul Reaver to plant Salaine’s severing \ndevice. Read or paraphrase the following aloud when the Explorers enter The  Soul Reaver.\nAs you slip through the open door that leads from the spined, treacherous hallways of Zaergarn’s palace into The Soul Reaver, you are struck by a pervasive sense of wrongness. The material from which the hull was wrought is diseased, plagued by the noxious touch of the warp. While the Dark Eldar palace was a place of unspeakable horror, the graceful arcs and alien curves of The Soul Reaver’s corridors have been wrenched to madness by its strange and lonely aeons in the void. You pass through the corridors for seconds or perhaps for years, time’s gyre widening and collapsing upon itself with the twists and turns of the halls. Eventually, you reach a cavernous room that seems to be the termination of passage \nand matches the description given by Salaine Morn.\nEven once they reach the correct room, a massive, circular \nchamber roughly 200 metres across, the Explorers must locate the proper place for Salaine’s device, which she described as “a massive pedestal, wrought with gemstones.” Players with the Psyniscience Skill automatically detect the pedestal and get a distinct feeling of wrongness upon entering the chamber; if no player has the Psyniscience Skill, the Explorers can still ﬁnd the pedestal by searching the room for it. Unless time is an issue, the Explorers locate the pedestal after 1d10+5 minutes of narrative time of searching."

Read or paraphrase the following aloud:\n Before you lies the corpse of a Dark Eldar, wearing the colours of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and various decorations on his armour and wargear that mark him as an Archon. It is clear he has been dead for many years, his desiccated ﬂesh hollow and grey beneath his barbed armour and cloak of ﬂayed ﬂesh. In places it appears his skin has fused with the pedestal upon which his corpse rests, the gemstones nearest to him glowing faintly in the ambient light. After you plant Salaine’s device on the pedestal, the lighted stones go dark for a moment before suddenly ﬂicking back to life. The Archon’s eyes, now lit by the same ghostly light as the glowing \nstones seem watch you, the dark pits in his sunken features glowing \nwith a spark of unnatural life. The malevolence that oozes from the corpse as surely as the sickening light suddenly but inexorably presses down upon you like a great weight. Even as you feel this spiritual weight take its toll, a wicked cackle cracks the air and you can hear the stamping of hurried feet approaching.In this combat, the Explorers are outmatched and \noutgunned by the forces of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, \nand Drecarus has ordered his soldiers to take these brazen \ninterlopers alive rather than killing them, that they might \nsuffer for their impertinence. Further, the presence of the \nExplorers or the integration of Salaine’s device has roused the slumbering heart of The Soul Reaver, which saps their \nvitality rapidly so long as they remain in its presence. As a ﬁnal complication, the only entrance to the chamber is the one that the Dark Eldar are using to enter—any others that exist are sealed by disrepair.\nThe Dark Eldar soldiers arrive in waves at the beginning \nof each Round, starting with the ﬁrst, and continue to arrive indeﬁnitely until the Explorers are defeated. The GM can use the waves in the order they are presented and then begin random rolls should they survive past ﬁve Rounds, or just randomise the sequence from the start by rolling on Table 1–1: Splintered \nTalon Forces on page 46. Further, The Soul Reaver’s stirrings \nput a vast mental strain on the ones who woke it—namely, the Explorers. To reﬂect this drain, each Explorer gains one level of Fatigue at the end of each Round. See Capturing the \nExplorers for suggestions on running this combat encounter.\nGM G UIDANCE : C APTURING  THE EXPLORERS\nThe conclusion of this chapter calls for the Explorers to be captured by the Dark Eldar and given to the Cult of the Withered Blade. The second chapter hinges on the capture of the Explorers, and revolves around their efforts to liberate themselves and return to their mission. However, the GM should consider his particular group when deciding on the exact circumstances of the Explorers’ (temporary) defeat. Some players may prefer simply being told that the odds are overwhelming once the hallway ﬁlls with the warriors of the Splintered Talon, while others may wish to struggle on to the bitter end, and only accept defeat when the last die has been cast and they lie drenched in the blood of countless foes, only beaten after climbing to the top of a mountain of broken corpses. Others still might seek—and even ﬁnd—a clever solution to the dire predicament, such as a path to escape. Indeed, this endless range of possibilities is why roleplaying games need a GM. For this section, the GM should keep in mind that he is giving the players a bitter pill to swallow, and try to be ﬂexible in delivering this setback in a way suitable for his speciﬁc group. \nThe GM should run the ﬁnal combat with several key points in mind. First, he should avoid killing the PCs outright, \nand try to have their foes take them alive. Conveniently, this is highly justiﬁable in this battle; Dark Eldar prefer to \ncapture their prey alive, so that they might draw the most possible sustenance from them. In the battle around The Soul \nReaver , as the ship drains their essence and Drecarus and his warriors attack, the GM can have warriors coming from the \nsole entrance and cutting off escape, making it plain this is a ﬁght the PCs cannot win, no matter how many warriors they send screaming to their deaths (though some groups may wish to try, and should be allowed to do so). If one or more of the Explorers is slain during this ﬁnal battle, it is also reasonable that the Dark Eldar would use their technology to bring them back from the edge of death, so they might suffer further torments, and if a PC does die the GM should allow that Explorer to survive the battle without the need to burn a Fate Point (and, if necessary, any inherently fatal results of Critical Damage, such a decapitation, should be undone by the dark sciences of the Haemonculi, albeit with possible consequences). Such capture can act as a sort of safety net for the ﬁrst chapter, if the GM so chooses—at any point when the entire group would suffer defeat or death during their journey to The Soul Reaver,  the Dark Eldar can drag \nthem back to Drecarus. This could cause the second chapter to start earlier than intended, but that should not cause any major problems in the overarching plot of the adventure in this book. \nWhile the adventure as written assumes that one way or another the Explorers will end up in captivity by the end of \nthe Chapter 1: The Queen of Shadows , this does not always have to be the case. Stealing The Soul Reaver  is impractical \nat this juncture, but it is still possible that they might escape the trap or somehow come up with a cunning plan that allows them to avoid their capture. The GM should allow the PCs to escape if they do come up with an especially good plan (such as if they send powerful minions into the ziggurat in their stead or if they plan out an escape route beforehand \nand ensure it is not compromised), bearing in mind that the strength of the Splintered Talon is considerable and Drecarus \nbecomes aware of them as soon as they activate Salaine’s device. If the players manage to overcome the odds, the GM will need to modify the events of Chapter II accordingly (see GM Guidance: Free Men on page 49 for more details)."

He thanks his former master for warning him of these aliens and their treachery, and begins a one-sided conversation with the corpse. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:\nAs you watch your hopes of escape slip away, the Haemonculus approaches you slowly. Even as he surveys you dispassionately, one of his hands works idly on an alien vital organ with scalpel, spurting blood across those around him. He turns towards the corpse slowly being absorbed by the strange material of the ship. “ And, my dear Archon, how are you faring?

Of course, I was not expecting you to give me yet another gift in the these... individuals, nor do I need any of them for my current experiments, but I suppose it is the thought that counts. Still, I’m sure Anyalra will put them to good use in the pits, and I appreciate the forewarning that they sought to steal this fascinating vessel.” The corpse sits stoically, its skeletal grin leering at you and the Haemonculus as the strange eldritch glow burns in its empty sockets. With a wave of one of his many hands, the Haemonculus signals a number of guards, who grab you and drag you off to your fate...\nThis concludes the ﬁrst chapter of the adventure, with the Explorers dragged off in chains to the arenas and the house of the Withered Blade, Salaine somewhere out of reach in the Nexus, and the Renegade Fleet waiting to begin their assault.

Don’t fool yourself into thinking there is anything noble or glorious about spilling your blood in their arenas; they are not marvelling at your prowess in battle when they cheer and hiss. It is the contorted expression of pain on your face when a blade bites \ninto your ﬂesh they truly crave.”\n–Ludvos Tarn, Battle-Brother of the Imperial Fists\nThe curtain on Chapter II: Blood, Sand, and Steel \nrises with the Explorers in captivity, having been \ncaptured by the Kabal of the Splintered Talon in \ntheir interrupted attempted to steal The Soul Reaver. There are \nnumerous ways in which the PCs can have run afoul of the Dark Eldar, though whether it is the result of falling in battle or walking into a trap, the end result is largely the same: they are stripped of their possessions and gifted by Zaergarn Kul (or rather, Drecarus acting in his name) to the Cult of the Withered Blade to begin their new lives as slaves. This section \ncharts their efforts to escape from their new captors, and \nalso provides the Explorers with a different and decidedly \nunpleasant perspective on the Dark Eldar, giving them a \nchance to see ﬁrst-hand how their twisted society works and how it relies on slaves and the agony of others to function. It is also a chance to meet others who have suffered a similar fate to the Explorers and have borne harsh misfortune in the Nexus, either as travellers turned prisoners who came to the city with different ambitions or as cargo taken during a raid from the surrounding regions and sectors from a world far away across the void. These fellow captives can prove useful to the Explorers and offer them critical assistance when the time comes to make their break for freedom.\nDespite the Explorers’ new goal of escaping from slavery, \ntheir mission and reason for coming to the Nexus of Shadows remains the same. Escaping allows them another chance at stealing The Soul Reaver. Even as they languish in bondage, trying \nto ﬁnd a path to freedom or using this new twist of fate to their \nadvantage, events continue to unfold around them and outside \nof the Pits. Salaine, and her renegade ﬂeet, continue to prepare for their invasion as they await the signal to attack. Coupled with the Explorer’s natural desire to escape and the obvious ill effects a long tenure in the arena may have upon their health, Salaine’s continued machinations and their integral role in her \nplan should be enough to spur the PCs into action.Slaves of the \nWithered Blade\nThe Explorers have been captured by the Dark Eldar, and now occupy the unenviable position of slaves in Dark Eldar society. Like countless others before them, \nthe Explorers are now at the mercy of the sadistic aliens. How this capture occurred depends on their actions in Chapter \nI: The Queen of Shadows, the exact nature of their initial assault on the Nexus, and how close they came to stealing The Soul Reaver. This chapter assumes that either using their \nsuperior technology, numbers, or knowledge, the Dark Eldar outmanoeuvred the Explorers and forced them to surrender, \nthough it is also possible that the PCs were defeated in battle \nand saved from death by the Dark Eldar so they could be tormented later for the amusement of the vile xenos. The end \nresult largely remains the same, albeit with different speciﬁcs \nthat may affect their situation in ways determined by the GM. \nThe Explorers are now under the power of the Dark Eldar and at least at the start of this chapter, they must cede to the alien’s orders and follow the path set before them until they can ﬁnd a chance to make their break for freedom.\nAs slaves, the Explorers have all of their personal \npossessions taken. Further, thanks to the dominance ensured by the Razor’s Web, the Explorer’s ship cannot make a move to help them without being destroyed, or is driven from the Nexus by the deadly defence spires. Regardless, the Explorers’ ship, and its crew, is not able to help them \ndirectly. Items and objects which the Explorers cannot \nphysically give up, such as bionics, integrated weapons, or \nsimilar enhancements are left in place by the aliens, but any \nnon-vital or exotic functions (integrated weapons systems, \netc) they may have are deactivated if the Dark Eldar discover them. This causes no lasting harm to the device, but the Explorers will not be able to call upon its special qualities during their time in slavery unless they can ﬁnd a way to replace the pilfered parts. In the case of any bionics the Explorers use to function, such as limbs or enhanced senses (such as eyes, ears, etc), the bionics remain operational.\nIN M EDIA  RES\nIt is perfectly possible to run large portions of this chapter as part of a stand-alone adventure. Any situation in which the Explorers face Dark Eldar raiders—in the Nexus of Shadows or anywhere else—and are defeated could easily segue into this situation. The plan to steal The \nSoul Reaver  in the third chapter could even be formulated \nby the Explorers during their time in captivity, though obviously this would take some work on the GM’s part to introduce important characters from the ﬁrst chapter, \nsuch as Salaine Morn, while they are enslaved and make \nsure that the narrative still ﬂows cohesively."

The Dark Eldar have extensive experience dealing with those who can call upon the powers of the warp, and \nhave developed a panoply of ﬁendish technology for dealing \nwith such individuals. This restraining technology can take \nmany forms, from arcane alien collars or sub-dermal implants to tattoos and bonds made exotic alien materials from beyond the light of the Imperium. Whatever device is used to stop \na psyker from using his powers, it is designed in such a way \nthat to remove it without the proper procedures might well critically injure the wearer. This could be because it has been grafted to his own skin or sewn into a vital organ, such as his heart or brain. It might even be somehow connected to the warp itself, funnelling off any power the psyker might try to gather before he can use it and opening him to possession and the full fury of the warp should he try and tear it off. Such devices are also rarely completely reliable, and the GM can have them work intermittently or only partially in some circumstances, allowing the psyker or Navigator to use his powers if the GM chooses, or in situations where there is an abundant of psychic energies for him to tap for power. The Dark Eldar also often have ways of circumventing their own devices, since they enjoy the anguish the warp can cause a \npsyker, and sometimes allow psykers to use their abilities in \nthe arena for their own dark amusement. Usually, a speciﬁc psychic suppression device has a countermeasure that can deactivate it remotely, and acquiring the key or a pass-phrase for the warp shackles of one’s astropath or navigator might be a crucial part of an escape plan.\nWhen the Explorers are taken into captivity, the Dark \nEldar store their equipment and weapons with the rest of \nthe slaves’ possessions, locking them in a vault and once in a \ngreat while distributing particularly rare prizes to members of \nthe Cult. It is a rare occurrence that any slave has anything in their possession which is of any real interest to the Dark Eldar. Even master-crafted weapons and rare examples of \nartefacts from the Dark Age of Technology are simply ﬂawed \nhuman garbage to them, and inferior to their own weapons and armour. This gear can be recovered by the Explorers once more when they escape, or during the escape if they can locate it, but for the time being is unceremoniously dumped into a pile locked deep in the Withered Blade’s holdings.\nGM G UIDANCE : FREE M EN\nThis chapter is designed around the premise that the Explorers have been captured by the Dark Eldar during their ﬁrst abortive attempt to steal The Soul Reaver . There are many way in which this can happen during the ﬁrst chapter, and \nany point at which the PCs are defeated in combat or fail to reach the ziggurat of Splintered Talon can result in them becoming slaves. It is a measure of the Dark Eldar’s contempt for all humans that they do not consider the Explorers a real danger (even if they manage to reach The Soul Reaver  and come close to stealing it), and upon their capture send them \nto the arena with all the other newly captured slaves instead of treating them as a credible threat. Depending on the GM and his group, and if he wants to explore alternatives to capturing the PCs, he can make changes to this section to reﬂect \nan outcome in which the Explorers either evade capture in the ﬁrst chapter or otherwise manage to free themselves from \nthe Dark Eldar before they are brought to the arena.\nThis can play out in one of two ways: the first is that the GM can deviate from the majority of Chapter II: \nBlood, Sand, and Steel , allowing the Explorers to flee from the Archon’s ambush and return to hiding in the \ncity to formulate a new plan. The second way is to have the Explorers infiltrate the Cult of the Withered Blade by posing as slaves as part of a plan to take The  Soul Reaver .\nIn the ﬁrst instance the Explorers will need to formulate a new way to reach The Soul Reaver , no small feat against the \nlegions of the Splintered Talon and the fully functional Razor’s Web. This task will be made even more difﬁcult because after the ambush in the ziggurat, the Dark Eldar will be on alert and actively searching for them. The PCs will also miss out on the aid from those they could recruit from the arenas and the distraction caused by the uprising they can start at the end of this chapter, and will need to gather allies and resources elsewhere. The GM can allow the players to pursue this path if they choose, formulating a new way to get to The Soul Reaver . Some, though obviously not all, of the NPCs detailed in this \nchapter could be repurposed to be members of the masses who eke out a living in the Shadow Arteries or the lower depths, and might be just as willing to rise up against the capricious and oppressive Dark Eldar as any slave gladiator.\nThe second outcome will play out in almost the same way as if the Explorers had been taken by force, except that they \nwill have the advantage of entering captivity on their own terms, and with their own plans in place. Salaine Morn, or another NPC, might suggest this path to create a vital distraction for claiming The Soul Reaver . If the Explorers do decide \nto inﬁltrate the Cult of the Withered Blade as slaves, they should receive some advantage for this—concealed weapons \ndelivered to them for the uprising, a contact loyal to Salaine Morn within the Cult, or any number of other small edges \ncan help make it clear that the Explorers are masters of their own fate even as they endure the lash of the wicked Cult."

Such is the contempt that Drecarus has for them that he does not even interrogate them, already aware of their involvement with Salaine from \nhis spies outside the Nexus. In his overconﬁdence, he cannot \nconceive how they could be a threat to his power, despite how close they have come to stealing The Soul Reaver. As a result, \nonce they have been removed from the ziggurat, the Explorers \nare thrown in with the other newly arrived slaves and sent to \nthe arena for Anyalra to use in her blood sport. There they \nare placed in pens awaiting a decision by the leader of the Withered Blade as to their fate and the new life they are about to begin in servitude to the Dark Eldar. When they ﬁrst enter or awaken in the custody of the Cult of the Withered Blade, read or paraphrase the following aloud:\nYou have been stripped of your weapons and other possessions, manacled, and dragged along with dozens of other humans and xenos into a vast open pit surrounded by a crown of rusty bloody spikes. Still bearing the scars of your battle with Drecarus and his warriors, you are for the moment at least in the thrall of the Dark Eldar Wych Cult of the Withered Blade. As the crowd of prisoners moves and mutters restlessly to itself, some of the \nother humans cast furtive glances in your direction, noting the \nsymbols and regalia of your dynasty. A dark shadow suddenly \nmoves against the edge of the pit. Standing over you is the ethereal \nﬁgure of a female Dark Eldar, her alabaster skin contrasting with \nthe brass, teal, and black of her armour and the cold dark of her soulless eyes. Eyes which even as you watch scan the cowering mass of slaves before ﬁnally settling on you and your companions.\nBefore she decides what to do with the Explorers, Anyalra \nwants to test their abilities to see if they will make a good show in the arena, or if they have other talents that the Cult of the Withered Blade might exploit. The Explorers stand out and are quickly separated from the rest of the slaves for their potential and skills—the bulk of those brought into the Shadowspine Pits are good for little more than menial physical labour (of the kind which the Dark Eldar would never lower themselves to undertake) or as scream-bags to die bleeding in the Pits. In spite of the obvious ﬂaws possessed by humans, Anyalra has a good eye for talent and those with the potential to put on a good spectacle in the arena; qualities \nthat she sees and wants to test in the Explorers.\nWhen Anyalra meets the Explorers, she is solely \ninterested in their ability to perform in the games to \nserve her Cult. She has no interest in any plots \nthey might have been hatching and is only passingly curious about their association with Salaine, an individual she considers no better or worse than Zaergarn, but has no interest in supporting if it jeopardises her own position. What the Explorers were before they came into her arena is of no consequence (something she reminds them of should they \ntry and preach their pedigree to her) and she is only interested \nin them based on their worth in combat.\nTHE FIRST RULE ABOUT \nSHADOWSPI NE...\nAfter they have been brought to the Shadowspine Pits and Anyalra \nhas seen them and decided they might have more potential than the other new slaves, the Explorers are put through a series of trials to test their worth to the Cult of Withered Blade. These trials test their skill at arms, their mental strength, and the way in which their suffering inﬂuences the crowd. They are also singled out to see if they have any additional talents that might prove useful to the Cult, in or out of the arenas. Anyalra is not personally present to witness these tests, for the Explorers do not yet rate her attention from among the thousands of slaves she is currently training or preparing for their deaths in the Shadowspine Pits, \nbut if they perform well, news will reach her and they will take \ntheir ﬁrst steps on the road to gaining favour within the cult, and thus the additional freedoms and opportunities they need to effect their escape or inﬁltrate the ziggurat. Instead, the tests are overseen by Unarlan, a Hekatrix Bloodbride and one of Anyalra’s favoured champions (see page 70 for details on Unarlan).\nThe ﬁrst test that all slaves undertake is the Trial of Blood, \nto determine their merit as ﬁghters. Those who distinguish themselves at this stage may catch the eye of the Cult, though whether this attention is a blessing or a curse is not always \nGM G UIDANCE :  \nROLEPLAYING  ANYALRA\nAnyalra leads the Cult of the Withered Blade, governing its arenas and the warriors who ﬁght there (willingly or otherwise). Since the days when Salaine still held sway in the Nexus, Anyalra has been in control of the cultivation and trafﬁc of the bulk of its slaves. The ﬁrst place a slave sees (and often the last) is the inside of the Withered Blade’s ﬁghting pits. Because of Anyalra’s dominance over the ever-important commodity of pain in the Nexus of Shadows, she has remained largely immune from the worst of the Dark \nEldar’s politics and the struggles for rulership of the \nNexus, her role being too valuable to usurp and her Cult too loyal to undermine or subvert. For her part, \nAnyalra is content to let the Archons play their games \nof power and squabble for an empty title of Master of \nthe Nexus, while she continues to grow wealthy off \nthe business of the arenas and gain plenty of fresh meat for her games and entertainment. A masterful warrior and connoisseur of battle, Anyalra is a complete professional in her own right, concerned only with her games and her endless search for the perfect kill."

The Dark Eldar take all the new slaves and pair them up \n(each Explorer should be pitted against a random NPC slave, and none should have to ﬁght each other for now). Guided by prods from above, the slaves are moved one pair at a time into a smaller adjoining pit, below the main pit where the \nother gathered slaves are able to watch. The GM can pair the \nExplorers with any of the other slaves, either from among the \nhumans or the xenos. If the GM wants to make this encounter more challenging, he can choose a naturally tough xenos (such as a Kroot or Ork) to face the Explorer in question or \nhe could have him paired with a familiar face, such as an NPC \nally who he met earlier in the Nexus. Once the slaves are in the lower pit by themselves, their captors remotely release their manacles and command them to ﬁght barehanded to the death (though, in actuality, the Dark Eldar separate the two and usually resuscitate the loser once one ﬁghter has been rendered unconscious). Those who refuse to ﬁght are ﬁrst threatened with death (and told that only one slave will be allowed to leave the pit alive) and then incapacitated with ranged weapons if they persist in their paciﬁsm.\nTo resolve the ﬁght the GM has two options. He can either \nrun a series of one-on-one, unarmed combat encounters, using the proﬁles for slave gladiators found on page 128 in Chapter IV: The Treacherous Path, or he can handle \nthings in a less detailed manner. For this simpler approach, \nthe GM should have each PC make an Opposed Weapon \nSkill Test against his opponent (again, using the proﬁles \nfound on page 128). In the simple method, the GM should provide the Explorers with bonuses based on roleplaying (a player who describes his Explorer tricking a stronger enemy into smashing himself against the spiked rim of the pit might receive a +10 bonus to his Weapon Skill Test, for instance) or on appropriate Skills and Talents that improve their capacity to ﬁght unarmed. Those Explorers who win the Opposed Test manage to beat their foe unconscious and are ushered away while another pair is brought into the pit. Those who are defeated are dragged from the pit unceremoniously by their Dark Eldar handlers and resuscitated elsewhere, regaining consciousness as their Test of Endurance begins. GMs may wish to know that it is also at this point that the combatants are reunited, and winners will realise that, in all likelihood, the losers of the battle have survived unless they were treated \nto a particularly brutal display during the Trial of Blood.\nRegardless of which method the GM uses, each Explorer \nwho wins his battle in the Trial of Blood earns the group one \nFavour, but may also ﬁnd himself faced with more challenging foes in the pits (see page 56 for rules regarding Favour).\nIS THAT ALL YOU’VE GOT?\nAfter they have been subjected to ﬁghting the other slaves, the Explorers are then given a test of their will, to see how much punishment they can undertake and if they are good stock for torture and the worst kinds of entertainment the pits have to offer. The Dark Eldar choose only the best candidates for most games, and thus must learn exactly how far they can push a slave before it will perish and must be repaired or replaced. Regrouped in a new chamber and manacled once more, the Explorers are led into a grisly chamber that appears to have once been some type of ﬂuids reclamation facility for the sphere, its machines, funnels, and turbines twisted by the Dark Eldar for their own terrible purposes. Here, the Explorers are subjected to mental and physical torment to test their limits and gauge their worth to the Withered Blade. The test takes two forms: the Trial of Agony, a test of endurance and suffering, and the Trial of Terror, a test of mental fortitude and sanity in the face of fear.\nThe Trial of Agony involves subjecting the victim to the various \ncommon tortures carried out by the Dark Eldar. The Explorers are held underwater, subjected to electrical pulses, and scorched \nby heat and ﬂame; their anguish is carefully noted by the Cult \neach step of the way. The GM should probably refrain into the \nspeciﬁcs of these trials, and the PCs’ exact reactions and tactics to \novercome them should remain equally obscured; simply making \na single Very Hard (–30) Willpower or Toughness Test to see how the Explorers fare is enough. As with the simpliﬁed version of the Trial of Blood, the Explorers can gain appropriate bonuses to this Test if they have any Talents that make them harder to kill, harm, or break, even if those Talents do not normally grant speciﬁc bonuses to enduring torture (some such Talents include the Die Hard, Unshakeable Faith, Duty Unto Death, and Hardy Talents). Those who pass remained conscious, and showed a measure of strength in the face of agony, while those who have failed have marked themselves out as limited in their uses to the Dark Eldar. Each Explorer who succeeds in the Trial of Agony earns one Favour for the group, but may also ﬁnd himself singled out for ever-increasing torments in the arena (see page 56 for rules regarding Favour)."

This test was created by the Dark Eldar to measure the mental strength of their slaves, and see how far they can bend their captives’ minds without shattering them entirely. It is a test of primal fear, in which the \nExplorers are exposed to something truly terrible. This torment \ncan take any form the GM chooses, and if the Dark Eldar know \nanything about the Explorers (perhaps from their efforts to \ninﬁltrate the Nexus’ twisted nobility) they use it against them. \nCommon examples of the Trial of Terror include dropping \nslaves down one of the gravity chutes to hang suspended by an arcane ﬁeld above the fusion core or forcing them to witness the gruesome death of another slave. Equally, they might be dropped into a pit with a terrifying foe such as a Genestealer or Khymera, unaware that the creature is held on an invisible leash by its masters. The end result is that the Explorers must make a Fear Test (see page 294 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook) against a creature or event with a \nFear Rating of 1. All bonuses from Talents or Traits that the Explorer would normally gain to Fear Tests apply to this Test, and bonuses and penalties should be applied based on the speciﬁcs of the Explorer and the object of horror. \nAn Explorer who passes this Trial proves that even if his \nbody is weak (if, for instance, he failed the Trial of Agony), his mind remains unclouded by fear. Explorers who succeed in the Trial of Terror earn one Favour for the group, but may ﬁnd themselves thrown against increasingly horriﬁc creatures, \nas the Dark Eldar watch with bated breath to see their vaunted \ncourage shatter before some overwhelming source of fear (see page 56 for rules regarding Favour).\nTHE BLOODY HAZE\nAfter the horrors of the converted production facility, the Explorers are given their ﬁrst taste of the arena and a chance to see how the crowd reacts to them. This is not an “honour” bestowed on every slave (many are not considered worthy of the arena), but the Explorers are obviously a cut above the rank-and-ﬁle who pass through the trials. Though the Dark Eldar spectators are far more interested in their suffering than their ﬁghting prowess, there may be other xenos or even humans in the stands who take an interest in the strength, cunning, and panache that the Explorers display while in battle.\nThe Dark Eldar gather together each Explorer and slave \nwho has been given the “privilege” of entering the arena in a \ngroup and sent into the arena. Once inside, each combatant is \ngiven the choice of weapons: a mono-sword (Melee; 1d10+2 R; Pen 2; Balanced), a great-maul (Melee; 2d10 I; Pen 0; Primitive, Unbalanced), or a mono-dagger (Melee; 1d5+2; Pen 2), xenos-craft bow (Ranged; 30m; S/–/–; 1d10+2 I; Clip 1; Reload Half; Primitive, Reliable), and 12 arrows. The GM should send in at least two human slaves (use the proﬁle for Tormented Human from page 129) along with the Explorers, and can add more depending on the combat abilities of the group. Those who enter the arena must face a fearsome Clawed Fiend (see page 134 for the proﬁle of a Clawed Fiend), which they must defeat with their primitive weaponry. The Clawed Fiend should target the NPC pit ﬁghters ﬁrst, and focus on the Explorers only after it has slain the NPCs. If the Explorers are in danger of being overwhelmed, the GM might choose to usher in another wave \nof slaves to assist them, giving them a chance to catch their \nbreath while the creature’s attention is on the newcomers.\nThe Explorers earn one Favour for killing the beast, but \ntwo Favour if they can make it suffer above and beyond what is necessary to kill it (see page 56 for rules regarding Favour). If the group is ever fully incapacitated by the Clawed Fiend, they are removed from the arena, patched up as much as the Dark Eldar see ﬁt (at the very least, they should be stabilised and have any immediately life-threatening wounds treated), and passed on to the slave pens."

These we claim.”\n–Words of the Cult of the Withered Blade\nWith the Trials and introductory battle concluded, the \nExplorers’ true life of slavery can commence. At this point, they have only had a chance to demonstrate \n(and rely upon) their martial prowess, but opportunities for characters whose skills lie more in verbal than physical persuasion have a chance to be very effective in the other roles that slaves fulﬁl for the Cult of the Withered Blade. The Cult of the Withered Blade takes perverse pleasure in subjecting skilled warriors to ritual humiliation, including performing menial tasks, and so they do not differentiate between slaves and \ngladiators except in the rare cases of warriors who cannot be \ncontrolled outside of the ring. Any warrior might ﬁnd himself \ncalled upon drag corpses from the arena or scrub the blood \nfrom a rack, much as any slave with no martial prowess might ﬁnd himself ﬂung into the ring to slay a Carnosaur, armed only with the scalpel that he was cleaning when told to ﬁght. As such, when not ﬁghting in the pits, the Explorers have access to the bulk of the Shadowspine Pits, itself a massive prison, and to its occupants, and may be called upon to perform all sorts of odious tasks for their dark masters.\nIn this part of the adventure, the Explorers can pass fairly \nfreely around the Shadowspine Pits, their Dark Eldar jailers only concerning themselves with the security of certain areas and the entrances and exits to the pits. Taking advantage of the inﬂuence they can acquire in and out of the arenas requires deft manoeuvring on the part of the Explorers.\nThe ﬁrst thing the GM should do once the trials are concluded \nis introduce the Explorers to their new life as slaves of the Withered \nBlade, making sure they are aware of the details of their captivity \nand the problems and advantages it presents to completing their mission. Doubtless the players are eager for escape, and the opportunity to begin plotting their liberation arises almost right away. Meeting the NPCs already in the house of the Withered Blade, ﬁghting in the pits, and performing various tasks for their captors will all speed this process along, and can allow the GM to impart information to the players that saves them from needing to make their own investigations about every tiny detail.\nA DREAM OF FREEDOM\nThe Explorers will almost certainly begin thinking of ways to escape as soon as they realise that they have fallen into the \nhands of the Dark Eldar. Their overarching mission for the \nadventure, however, remains the same: they must still \n“liberate” The Soul Reaver from the Splintered Talon’s \nziggurat before the renegade ﬂeet can arrive and \nlaunch its assault. Without their success, Salaine’s \nmachinations cannot move forward, and they risk losing any deal or proﬁt to be reaped from their situation (to say nothing of recouping the losses they have suffered to get \nthis far). The GM should be careful in this section to make clear \nthat the players have not failed even though their ﬁrst attempt was thwarted. This should be seen as a mere setback, a chance to attack the problem from a different angle and just another obstacle to overcome. Giving the Explorers opportunities to meet new allies, make new inroads, and form new plans to steal The Soul Reaver will help remind them that they are masters of \ntheir own fate even though they have fallen upon hard times. \nOne of the ﬁrst steps on the road to freedom is meeting \nDomos Agnelain. Once the Explorers have become acquainted with the venerable Tech-Priest, they can seriously start to consider their escape, as he can offer them a wealth of information about the Withered Blade and present them with a number of decent plans. He also makes it clear to them that the sealed doors and high pits, not to mention the patrols \nof Wyches and Kabalite Warriors, make a frontal assault by \nunarmed slaves tantamount to suicide, and that they must \nprepare and ﬁnd the right moment to strike.\nDomos explains to the Explorers that he has long \ndreamed of freedom, especially the freedom to explore \nthe Gaelan Sphere and its many techno-arcane mysteries, and has cogitated long upon a vast number of alternative paths to escape despite lacking the power to enact any of them. He tells the Explorers that to make any serious break for freedom they require weapons, the support of other capable slaves, and a large distraction."

He chatters rapidly, seemingly to himself. “What have we here, Pridius? Is this truly the path back to the Omnissiah’s glorious embrace—what? No, we have no time to cogitate upon those formulas now, my friend! W e must act!” He begins to move with an unexpected pace, examining the Explorers, occasionally poking and prodding before he comes to a halt, apparently satisﬁed. “Indeed. As Pridius said, you have an auspicious look about you, and he has advised me that our chances of escape will probabilistically never be higher. My own cogitations on the matter are in accord. You could do it—you could engineer the uprising I have envisioned. Your odds of success are non-trivial. You shall have my help in your endeavours—and Pridius’ utmost aid too, of course, even if he can be a bit sour at times.”\nDomos elaborates, explaining some of their options. First, he explains that even though they are slaves, they can earn favour with the Cult of the Withered Blade, and use this influence to help them plan their rebellion. He has used his own usefulness to survive for decades despite the hellish conditions, and if the Explorers earn glory in the arena or favour in the devious social circles that surround it, they can use this social currency to move their plans forward in small but important ways.\nDomos ﬁrst suggests that they should rouse the slaves in a \nrebellion, which requires bringing certain key individuals to their side. He also offers the idea of securing access to weapons for the uprising itself, either by winning outside support from a patron of the arenas or ascertaining the locations of weapons stockpiles. Finally, he makes it clear that information is key to the success of their break for freedom, and though he can provide basic information on the layout and organisation of the Shadowspine Pits, any codes to restricted areas, information about guard patrols, or ciphers to open the beast-pens could be pivotal in their victory.\nUnfortunately, as Domos notes, all of this may take some \ntime, and for the moment the Explorers need to play the wicked games of the Withered Blade to bring their plans to fruition. This section can therefore be as long or as short as the GM chooses, based on the actions of the PCs, culminating at a time when the Explorers feel that they are ready to make their move and have given themselves the best possible chance for success.\nGM G UIDANCE : D OMOS  THE BLOODSMITH\nDomos Agnelain the enslaved Adeptus Mechanicus Magos, is a major NPC in this part of the adventure and is the foremost of the allies the Explorers can make amongst the gladiators and slaves of the Withered Blade Cult. Domos came to the Gaelan Sphere seeking ancient technology and the secrets of a lost age; what he found was only enslavement and pain, the worst of which is perhaps the knowledge that countless secrets and pieces of lost archeotech rest literally under his feet and yet he cannot explore them. \nFor years he has suffered in the service of the Withered Blade, his skills turned to mending their gladiators and \nsubverting the machinery of the Sphere for the Dark Eldar, unable to escape alone and waiting for his chance to return to the Imperium—or, better yet, return to his research of the Sphere. Domos can help the Explorers become the catalyst for the uprising at the end of this chapter, and can provide substantial aid in leading the slaves against the Dark Eldar and setting the Nexus ablaze (also, incidentally, giving the PCs the perfect chance to try to abscond with The Soul Reaver  \nagain). When the Explorers arrive in the pits for the ﬁrst time they meet him, and it quickly becomes apparent that he is among the oldest and most revered of the slaves here—and also one of the most deranged, albeit in a relatively harmless way, carrying on frequent “conversations” with his vanished mentor “Magos Pridius” even as he sutures a patient back together or constructs makeshift prosthetics for those whose limbs cannot be recovered. \nDomos is the Explorers’ ﬁrst and foremost contact and ally amongst the slaves of the Withered Blade, who may use him \nas a way to guide the PCs towards formulating an escape plan and helping them to unite the slaves against the Dark Eldar. He can also help the Explorers with weapons and alien technology, patch them up if they are wounded in the arena, craft certain commonplace items, and can even restore limbs and organs should they be damaged or destroyed, though for the PCs this means replacing mangled arms, legs, or eyes with strange devices cobbled together from whatever Domos can scavenge. Because of his terrible dearth of supplies, any items crafted by the Magos, including cybernetic replacements, count as being of Poor Craftsmanship. If Domos had access to better materials, he would be able to create better items.\nGM G UIDANCE : SALAINE □S M OVE\nAfter being captured by the Dark Eldar, the Explorers might rightly wonder where Salaine is now, and why she does not immediately rush to their aid. Of course, savvy Explorers may correctly guess that such heroics are anathema the Dark Eldar way, but those less knowledgeable of the devious nature of these xenos may wish to know why she is not rendering assistance to the Explorers, who are if nothing else critical to her plan’s success.\nThrough the machine they planted on The Soul \nReaver , Salaine observed their defeat and capture, and \nshe has begun adjusting her plans to deal with this new development. The GM can use her to give the Explorers aid while they are in captivity, sending tools or information to help them escape, though she is very careful not to put herself in direct danger. The GM can alternatively have Salaine go silent. They might spot her in the stands of the arena, trying to win over the support of one of the factions represented there, or they might not see her at all—either outcome could easily inﬂame their suspicions about her possible betrayal."

Smuggling in weapons and gear, doing tasks for \nother slaves, or stealing codes for gates and machines all hinge on the mood of their captors. The Explorers gain Favour by proving their worth in the arena or outside of it, and must gather it so they can bend the rules of their enslavement enough to allow them to make their uprising a reality. The GM can use Favour as a guide to allow the PCs the chance to gain certain items and information vital to their escape plan. Once they have the weapons, codes, allies, and secrets they need, they can then commence their escape. Any member of the group \nmay spend Favour regardless of who originally earned it.\nGAINING FAVOUR\nGenerally, the Explorers gain Favour in one of three ways \n(though special cases such as the Trials also award Favour):\nGLORY  IN THE ARENA\nIf the Explorers can put on a vicious show in the arena, defeat powerful foes, and make impressive displays (ultimately causing their opponents—and possibly themselves—the maximum amount of pain) the Dark Eldar use them again for matches, and thus ensure their continued existence. Glory in the arena may draw the eye of other groups that attend the \ngames (such as Kroot mercenary warbands, Ork Freebooters, \nhuman pirates and slavers, and a plethora of others). Unlike the Dark Eldar, these groups are interested in the ﬁghting prowess of an Explorer as much as his suffering. These aliens can come from the Nexus or beyond, and can become useful allies and help the Explorers escape. Details on setting matches can be found on page 62 under The Shadowspine Pits. The GM \nshould use the following guidelines for awarding Favour:\nVictory or Death\nWinning a ﬁght in the pits grants the Explorers at least one Favour, even if only one of their number remains conscious (or alive) to walk away, provided they have vanquished all their enemies.Close Quarters\nWhen the Explorers win an arena battle in which they are only armed with melee weapons, or weapons with the Primitive Quality, they receive an additional Favour.\nOutnumbered and Outgunned\nWhen the Explorers win a battle in which they are signiﬁcantly outnumbered or are facing enemies of a signiﬁcantly higher calibre than themselves (such as veteran gladiators like Hekatrix Bloodbrides or a monstrous foes like Fleshwrought Drakes), they receive an additional Favour.\nSERVICE  TO THE DARK M ASTERS\nOutside the arena the Explorers, especially those who do not excel in the arenas, can also make themselves known by meeting the needs of the Withered Blade and its honoured guests. This can mean completing any number of tasks (some as dangerous as ﬁghting in the arena) to gain the favour of the Dark Eldar. Details on service to the house and how the Explorers can gain Favour in completing them can be found below in Service \nto the Wicked (page 70). The GM should use the following guidelines for awarding Favour:\nA Job W ell Done\nCompleting a task within the house for their Dark Eldar masters grants the Explorers one Favour.\nInspired W ork\nWhile the Dark Eldar do not usually reward initiative in their slaves, if the Explorers can complete a task with even better results than intended, they receive an additional Favour.\nAgonising Outcomes\nThe Dark Eldar relish pain before all else and if the Explorers manage to cause somebody to suffer unnecessarily during the completion of a task, they gain an additional Favour.\nTREACHERY  AND DECEIT\nEither from their place in the arena or as household slaves, the Explorers can try to sway their captors through treachery and manipulation, using the secrets and alliances of the Dark Eldar against them. This is a very dangerous game, as the Dark Eldar are masters of betrayal and lies, and their politics are often deadly and ﬁnal. Nonetheless, canny Explorers may attempt to learn secrets about their masters, or uncover stresses in alliances and compacts between Dark Eldar nobles to manipulate events for their own ends. See A Game within a Game on page 69 for details on tasks \nthey might be called to perform and individuals they might meet during that time. The GM should use the following guidelines for awarding Favour:\nLies and Scandal\nThe Explorers can uncover a secret and use it against one of their masters or their guests to earn one Favour. They gain an additional Favour whenever they learn a secret that implicates a group or alliance."

Using what they have learnt against the Dark Eldar to uncover additional clandestine knowledge or dealings grants the Explorers an additional Favour on top of any granted by the new revelation.\nUSING FAVOUR\nThe Explorers can use Favour to gain weapons, secrets, or manipulate events, eventually allowing the Explorers to escape. It can be imagined that the Explorers gain Favour in a variety of forms, and Favour does not necessarily equate to someone owing the Explorers a good turn or the PCs gaining extra privileges from their masters. Favour is always a form of “soft” power, and can stand for a plethora of different means to their end. Favour represents standing amongst the slaves of the pit, however it also represents the ability to slip a word into the right ear, the opportunity to overhear a piece of information, or sometimes simply the blind \nluck of being in the right place at the right time. The Explorers \nnever gain the ability to control or directly demand things of their Dark Eldar captors, but the Explorers might use Favour for clever and highly subtle manipulation to get the results that they desire. For a speciﬁc list of items, services, and information that can be acquired through Favour, see Table 2–1: Favour.\nTable 2—1: Favour\nFavour Cost Effect\n2\nThe Explorers gain one method for bypassing a single ﬁeld, blast door, or other containment. This \ninformation can be used during the uprising to free more slaves and speed their escape, or to free beasts \nfrom their pens to create a distraction.\n2\nThe Explorers acquire information about the layout of the Shadowspine Pits, including the location \nof a speciﬁc individual or item, the paths of patrols in an area, the location of a weapons cache, or the \nposition of static defences.\n2\nThe Explorers acquire a single item that ranges from Ubiquitous to Common Availability for immediate \nuse, for themselves or for any NPC captive of the Withered Blade Cult.\n2\n The Explorers may choose to substitute one slave gladiator for any other in a given arena battle.\n3\nThe Explorers inﬂuence who they are ﬁghting in the arena next. Before the roll has been made, the \nExplorers may choose the result of a roll on \n Table 2–3: Arena Foes\n  or \nTable 2–6: Arena Hazards\n .\n3\nThe Explorers can acquire a single item that ranges from Average to Scarce Availability for immediate \nuse, for themselves or for any NPC prisoner..\n5\nThe Explorers use Favour to tap into what is perhaps the greatest and most unsettling resource of the \nDark Eldar: the Haemonculi and their unnatural mastery over life and death. If an Explorer is killed \nin battle under sufﬁciently impressive circumstances and gives the crowd a particularly twisted death \nto relish, the group may spend ﬁve Favour if the late Explorer does not have a Fate Point left to burn \nto avoid death (or does not wish to burn a Fate Point). If they do, a the Explorer catches the eye of \nThe Sutured Helix and for whatever inscrutable reasons, the Coven decides to return him to life—or \nsomething resembling it. The Explorer suffers 1d5 permanent Fellowship Damage and 1d5 permanent \nDamage to one other randomly selected Characteristic, and returns, disﬁgured and “gifted” with an odd \nnew augmentation (see \n Table 2–2: Gifts of the Coven\n ). Favour used this way does not count towards \nthe total that the Explorers must earn and expend on their escape efforts.\nTHE ROAD TO FREEDOM\nBefore the Explorers can escape the Shadowspine Pits and continue their mission to remove The Soul Reaver , \nthey need to be adequately prepared. There is no set amount of Favour the Explorers must gain or expend before they can attempt their escape, and the GM should \nset this limit based on how long he wants to make this \nsection of the adventure. Each point of Favour can be used to make their escape easier, and the GM should ensure that the PCs at least make allies within the slave population before they try a serious break for freedom, but the GM might also impose a set amount of Favour that the Explorers must earn and expend in service of their efforts before an opportunity to escape arises. 25 Favour is a reasonable level to set, and makes most groups of Explorers work for their freedom. The GM can present this as the amount of work the PCs are required to perform to create a major distraction that sets the uprising in motion or to create a chance at escape.\nand highly subtle manipulation to get the results that they desire. \nFor a speciﬁc list of items, services, and information that can be \nacquired through Favour, see \n Table 2–1: Favour\n .\nTable 2—1: Favour\nFavour Cost Effect\nThe Explorers gain one method for bypassing a single ﬁeld, blast door, or other containment.

These NPCs come from \na variety of backgrounds, some staunch servants of the God-Emperor with faith in the Imperium, others servants of the Dark Powers plucked from the Screaming Vortex or aliens captured from the Koronus Expanse by Dark Eldar raiders. \nAs slaves of the Withered Blade, the Explorers can be called \nupon to ﬁght alongside this motley group of prisoners, or ﬁght against them, forcing them to deal with their own ingrained hatreds or alliances regarding elements of the Imperium and its many enemies. Every one of these fellow slaves can help the Explorers, both to escape the Shadowspine Pits and also steal \nThe Soul Reaver, if they can win them over. In many cases, the \nonly common point the Explorers share with an alien or \nrenegade NPC is a mutual desire to be free from slavery \nand exact some kind of vengeance on the hated \nDark Eldar of the Cult of the Withered Blade or \nthe Kabal of the Splintered Talon.The NPCs detailed below form a pool of potential allies \nand enemies who can either help the Explorers escape or complicate their plans. Once they meet Domos and he calculates the odds, he decides that the Explorers are his optimal chance \nto escape. To this end, he suggests to them that they try to \nrecruit some of the other slaves to their cause, and offers a list \nof those he believes to be the most able and skilled individuals \nwho would increase their probability of victory. The GM can use Domos as a font of information about the slaves and their motivations, even making introductions (since Domos has been here longer than any other the slaves), though it is up to the Explorers to win them to their cause. Gaining the support of a slave can involve a number of different things, as each slave has his or her own agendas beyond just escaping. Each slave also brings specialist skills and access to different tools to aid in the escape, as well as additional support later to help with the theft of The  Soul Reaver.\nFor better or for worse, each slave has brought his own \nhatreds and beliefs with him into captivity. This means that while the Explorers gather together allies and foment an uprising, they must contend with some slaves refusing to deal with others or even turning to the Dark Eldar if they feel they \nare being left out of the Explorers’ plans. If the Explorers do \nnot tread carefully, they may ﬁnd themselves ostracised by the allies they have already made, or trapped between old grudges brought into the arena by stubborn individuals. This means that for every ally the Explorers make, they may also make a foe, who can turn out to be deadly to their plans for any number of reasons. These foes can be dealt with a number of ways, but often require a direct and permanent solution on the sands of the arena. \nTable 2—2: Gifts of the Coven\n1d5 Roll Augmentation\n1\nHorriﬁc Limb: \n The Explorer gains a unique ﬂeshcrafted limb, grafted permanently onto his body to \nreplace one that was lost or simply because of the pique of the Haemonculi.

Tarn is a veteran of lifetimes of war, and his face is covered in deep, biting scars but his eyes are still sharp. A great prize, he was ﬁrst presented to Zaergarn and \nhis Haemonculus Drecarus, though after the Haemonculus \nfailed to break his will, he was sent to the pits and the care \nof the Withered Blade to die in the arena. His strength and \nstature are legendary among the denizens of the Nexus, and many xenos come to watch the warrior ﬁght while buying \nand selling their slaves. The human slaves of the Withered \nBlade stand in awe of this giant, and he has become revered as an icon of hope and Imperial might by many of them. Tarn ﬁghts so that he does not dishonour his Chapter by accepting defeat, and hopes that one day he might escape and return to his brothers. Tarn is a fanatical servant of the Emperor and the Imperium, and while he represents a powerful ally for the Explorers, he can also become a dangerous enemy if they fraternise too closely with the xenos or converse with the servants of the Dark Gods. In these circumstances, he may well turn on those he considers unclean as soon as he has his freedom, cutting down aliens and other allies working with the PCs and placing them in the dangerous situation of \nchoosing sides against a Space Marine.\nUnlike most of the other gladiators, Tarn is kept conﬁned \nnear the arenas between bouts in the pits, held by Adamantium \nshackles that even he cannot break. The Explorers can visit his cell without too much difﬁculty, but releasing him from it is an entirely different proposition. The proﬁle for Brother-Sergeant Ludvos Tarn can be found on page 130.\nRecruitment:•\t  Ludvos Tarn wants to escape as much as \nany of the slaves, and what he desires most to this end is the return of his power armour and personal weapons. These are being held in Anyalra’s personal chambers as trophies; anyone who retrieves them earns his respect and greatly increases Tarn’s effectiveness in combat.Support:•\t  Tarn is a combat machine, especially when armed \nand armoured, and though he is far from immortal, his \nstrength could prove a tremendous asset. This makes escape \nfrom the Shadowspine Pits much more feasible, not to \nmention attempts to steal The  Soul Reaver. His support also \nmakes it easier to convince other Imperial loyalists to join in \nthe rebellion, though it also unnerves dissidents and xenos who are familiar with the Emperor’s Angels of Death.\nAllies and Enemies: Tarn may stomach the Explorers making alliances with xenos until they have made their escape, but he does not tolerate the presence of Warp-wyrd Neija Tromean, let alone true agents of Chaos. \nCAPTAIN  ANJA SHEN , C OMMANDER  OF \nTHE HOSTILE  TRANSACTION\nThe Explorers and their ship are not the only vessel to have fallen afoul of the treachery of the Dark Eldar based on the promise of easy proﬁt. Among those enslaved by the Withered Blade is Captain Anja Shen, of The Hostile Transaction, along \nwith a good proportion of her crew. Captain Shen is a stout, middle-aged woman with rough manners, little tolerance for fools, and an eye for great proﬁt. Like the Explorers, she was lured to the Nexus after hearing dark tales of the wealth that would be made trading with its aliens, and she has never held any reservations about involving herself in the Cold Trade. \nSetting out from Footfall, The  Hostile Transaction followed the \nwebway using ancient maps bought at great expense by Shen, \neventually leading the captain and her crew to the Dark Eldar outpost. In spite of the dangers the Nexus presents, Shen might have made away with a fortune in xenos tech or slaves if she hadn’t succumbed to her weakness for gambling. Much to her chagrin, Anyalra cut her champion down in the arena and cost her both her ship and her crew, the shadow of the Razor’s Web preventing any thoughts of backing out of the wager.\nSince that day, Shen has been struggling to survive in the \nWithered Blade’s slave pens as her crew slowly dwindles around her. She dreams of her chance to be free, to reclaim her vessel, and exact her revenge on Anyalra. She is interested in joining with the Explorers, and it is even possible that they already share contacts in the Koronus Expanse or Calixis Sector. Once \nGM G UIDANCE : A NGELS  OF DEATH\nGMs who make use of Ludvos Tarn should make sure that, while his presence is worthy of the mighty Adeptus Astartes, he does not overshadow the Explorers. There are many ways to handle this, but most of them boil down to simply separating him from the party whenever \nhe would threaten to steal the Explorers’ thunder. Tarn \nshould, of course, still be very useful to the Explorers, like any other contact, but at no point should he make them feel marginalised within their own story. A few complications that could be used to remove Tarn from the picture at a critical juncture are listed below:\n•\tIf\tthe\tExplorers\thave\tnot\tyet\treturned\this\tarmour\t\nand weapons when the uprising begins, Brother Tarn informs them that he is duty-bound to retrieve these relics, and departs for some time to retrieve them.\n•\tMagos\tDomos\tcalculates\tthat\ttheir\todds\tof\tsuccess\t\nin the insurrection are greatest if the rebels can draw the guard patrols away from the beast pens by creating a distraction in the household. After they free him from his cell, Brother Tarn offers to lead a small group to lure \nthe enemy astray while the Explorers execute the plan. \n•\t A\tpowerful\t Incubus\t champion \tis\tvisiting\tthe\t\nShadowspine Pits just prior to the rebellion, and one \nof their contacts marks him as a threat. Brother Tarn volunteers to face him alone and bring him down so that the Explorers can pursue other goals unimpeded."

Captain Anja Shen’s proﬁle can be found on pages 129-130.\nRecruitment:•\t  Anja Shen wants a chance to exact her \nrevenge on Anyalra, or at very least take the haughty xenos down a peg or two. If the Explorers can ﬁnd \na way to embarrass or hurt the pride of the Cult of \nthe Withered Blade or better yet, Anyalra herself, then Shen agrees to join them.Support: •\t Once Shen is free, she can be of great aid to \nthe Explorers if she is reunited with her vessel, and can support them with her ship in the battle above the Nexus against the Splintered Talon. Her vessel can also be of use in helping the Explorers reclaim their own vessel or stage an escape into the void. The  Hostile Transaction is a Havoc-class \nmerchant raider vessel (see page 195 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  \nCore Rulebook for the proﬁle for these voidships).Allies and Enemies: •\t Shen is fairly open-minded when \nit comes to making alliances, and though she does not truly trust anyone, she can work with virtually any other NPC the Explorers recruit. She is always wary around Eldar and Dark Eldar (two groups between which she, \nlike almost all humans, sees no distinction) given her \ntime in the pits.\nNASHRIK  HAKH , SAVAGE  KROOT\nAmong those enslaved by the Withered Blade, there are also numerous aliens, not least of which are several Kroot. The most prominent of these is Nashrik Hakh, a veteran of battles in the Jericho Reach and one of the few survivors of her clan after it fell into the grips of the Dark Eldar. Like all Kroot, Hakh cuts an imposing ﬁgure, but she has not escaped the pits without its scars: her green ﬂesh is mottled by discolouration, \nher beak has a long chip cut from it, and she suffers from \nperiodic twitches when she is not in battle. Hakh has adapted \nfairly well to her life of slavery and combat, though she \nsuffers from the lingering physiological and psychological \neffects of consuming ﬂesh ridden with vile cocktails of Dark Eldar chemical enhancements. Hakh’s Shaper was also killed during the raid that saw her enslaved, and she feels the lack of direction and guidance she once had. An able warrior and a vicious foe, Hakh can be of use to the Explorers in their escape and in winning battles in the arena, though they must ﬁnd a way to communicate with her, as she speaks only her native tongue and the language of the Tau.\nIf they can bring her to their side, Nashrik Hakh also \nbrings with her a half-dozen other Kroot (the remains of her clan). Her clan can become a staunch ally to the Explorers even beyond the environs of the Nexus, provided that the Explorers treat them well and allow them to sup upon the ﬂesh of many fallen foes. Nashrik Hakh’s proﬁle can be found on page 131. \nHakh’s surviving kin use the Kroot Mercenary proﬁle from \npage 377 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook, but use \nthe same equipment list as Nashrik Hakh.Recruitment:•\t  Nashrik Hakh wants to eat her ﬁll from \nthe corpse of a powerful foe and complete the rituals of her people. Normally the dead are swiftly removed from the pits after a match and the gladiators are not allowed to linger. As such, the Kroot can only glut themselves on what ﬂesh they have ripped away during combat, and this is often polluted by the various drugs the Dark Eldar employ. If the Explorers can kill or otherwise secure such a corpse for Hakh, and allow her the time to feed \nproperly, she considers herself in their debt and throws \nherself behind their cause.\nSupport:•\t  Hakh and her fellow Kroot add much needed \nmuscle to any escape attempt, their savagery unmatched \nby any of the human slaves once battle is joined. The \nKroot are also able to aid the Explorers later in their \nbattles for the Nexus and The Soul Reaver, their loyalty is \nbeyond question once they have been bought. Allies and Enemies: •\t The Kroot do not have any \nideological problem with any of the other NPCs the Explorers might recruit, unburdened as they are by excessive morals or religious dogma. They eye their allies (including the Explorers) with unmasked hunger from time to time, though, and should a worthy warrior die in battle, they may ask if they can honour the fallen by feeding on his ﬂesh—much to the discomfort of many of the other NPCs.\nNEIJA TROMEAN , W ARP-W YRD\nNeija Tromean is likely the most ill-omened individual amidst the unfortunate rabble who populate the slave pens of the Cult of the Withered Blade. However, unlike most, Tromean’s misfortune is not hers alone. In her wake, at least four Imperial vessels have been reduced to husks in the void and a frontier world found itself devastated by Dark Eldar raiders. Despite this impressive reputation, Tromean hardly looks the part—slim, with ragged black hair and one eye covered after she lost it in the pits, the Warp-wyrd does not stand out from the rest of the beleaguered human slaves except for the intricate alien device \naround her neck. She, like so many other outcasts, has found \nher way to the Nexus of Shadows as a slave of the Cult of the Withered Blade, to which she was gifted by a rival Wych Cult hoping to gain inroads into the Nexus. On top of her rather impressive reputation for bearing witness to disaster, Tromean is an unsanctioned psyker of some ability. Though she holds no particular love of the Imperium, she is hardly a dedicated servant of the Dark Gods either, and tends to side with those who show strength. While she is currently bound by suppressant shackles and restraining bolts to prevent her accursed powers from manifesting, she is a fairly capable ﬁghter in her own right—and would be a terrifyingly powerful ally (or enemy) if unleashed. Neija Tromean’s proﬁle can be found on page 131\nRecruitment: •\t Neija Tromean wants the key that Anyalra \nholds so that she might use her powers properly. Like most things of value, Anyalra keeps the key in her \npersonal chambers or on her person at any given time, \nthough it might go unnoticed for some time if stolen given how infrequently she uses it."

Tromean is also a great asset when dealing with The  Soul Reaver, as her connection to the warp \nallows her certain insights into the ancient machine.Allies and Enemies: •\t Tromean distrusts the Space \nMarine Ludvos Tarn, given his strict stance on psykers, and distrusts all Eldar, though she will work with anyone in the struggle towards freedom. However, if she \nsees an opportunity to escape (once her shackles have \nbeen removed, of course), she takes it unless persuaded otherwise by the Explorers or their allies.\nRELHADHAR  ANTARIEL ,  \nTHE HAWK  AT SHADOW □S EDGE\nRelhadhar Antariel, an Eldar Corsair and famed xenos pirate of the Koronus Expanse, has suffered long years of torment at the hands of ﬁrst the Kabal of the Splintered Talon and then the Cult of the Withered Blade. Antariel’s shaggy white mane falls around a delicate face usually split by a hateful grin, and his arms are badly scarred from some incident he refuses to mention. The pirate’s solid black eyes are as unreadable as those of any of his kin, but the Hawk makes no effort to conceal the rage that nourishes him. Only by nursing a deep hatred and burning thirst for revenge has Antariel survived, doing whatever it takes to stay alive and one day see the open space of the Koronus Expanse again. He is the \nmost wary of the NPCs that the Explorers encounter, having \nseen many slaves come and go, each one with unique but universally futile dreams of freedom. If the Explorers can win the Corsair over, he is a skilled pilot and ﬁghter, and possesses an extensive knowledge of the Archon’s palace from his time as a “guest” of Zaergarn Kul some years ago. He does not like any aliens very much, but is smart enough to know that the Dark Eldar make no distinctions between their slaves when it comes to dishing out tortures and torment. As such, he may ﬁnd common cause simply in the fact that the Explorers suffer as he does under the boot of the Cult of the Withered Blade. His proﬁle is on page 131.\nRecruitment: •\t Antariel demands a display of the \nExplorers’ power before he sides with them. They must defeat at least one group of Dark Eldar in the arena, \nshowing no mercy. If they can slaughter these foes in \na suitably bloody display, the Corsair approaches them, though more is required before he makes a solid and formal alliance. The Explorers must prove their skill and hatred of the Dark Eldar by killing a Dark Eldar noble while he is a guest of the Withered Blade. This can be done by goading or tricking him into the arena or through subtler means, so long as the noble dies. If they can do this, and get away with it, the Hawk can be convinced to throw in his lot with them.Support: •\t The Corsair is an exceptional pilot and can \nhelp the Explorers reach the ziggurat in a stolen Dark Eldar vehicle once they escape. During the battle for the Nexus, if he has a ﬁghter or escort at his command, he can aid them and the renegade ﬂeet against the Splintered Talon. He can also use some of the systems aboard The \nSoul Reaver, aiding them in its theft or destruction if he is with them when they board the ship.Allies and Enemies:•\t  Once he has pledged his alliance \nwith the Explorers, Antariel accepts their other allies without question, provided none of them are Dark Eldar (though he might, grudgingly and with much complaint, tolerate a handful of Dark Eldar Explorers who share his predicament). If he ever discovers that the Explorers are in fact working for a Dark Eldar Archon, the Explorers must convince him to stay true to their cause, and not try to slay their Dark Eldar allies or simply depart on his own.\nOTHER  NPC G LADIATORS\nIn addition to the NPC gladiators presented in detail in this section, the GM can add extra gladiators for the Explorers to ﬁght against or recruit for their cause. Most slaves are human, and can hail from almost anywhere within the Koronus Expanse or the Calixis Sector, originating from any world or representing any faction, Imperial or otherwise. There are sundry aliens enslaved by the Withered Blade, including but not restricted to Eldar (of all varieties), Tau, Kroot, and Orks, all of which can make for interesting \nallies drawn together by the common foe of their \noppressors. See page 128 for the proﬁles for each of the NPC slaves of the Withered Blade."

      "text": "62\n62\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nThe \nShadowspine \nPits\nThe pits exist for a single purpose: the spilling of blood \nand the delivering of death for the sadistic nourishment of the Dark Eldar. The entertainment of their allies \nis a useful but entirely incidental by-product of this terrible goal. Every day, ceaseless rounds of contests and games are set \nwithin the arenas of the Shadowspine Pits. Some are organised \nto display the prowess of slaves for sale or the viciousness of \nbeasts, others might be held to provide a diversion for visiting xenos, who can place bets on the gory entertainment, or so that the Dark Eldar might soak up the agony of the ﬁghters. \nAn almost endless stream of slaves pours into the Nexus for \nthe sole purpose of suffering in the pits, and much of the economy and purpose of the city’s existence hinges on their existence, making it a central location for many of the deals and meetings of those who visit the Dark Eldar outpost. It is possible that the Explorers themselves visited the pits when they ﬁrst arrived, and sat in its arenas to witness the brutal games on offer. If this is the case, it provides a stark contrast to their current predicament, looking up through the fanged crown of spikes at the expectant faces leering at their pain.\nA large part of the Explorers’ time as slaves of the Withered \nBlade is consumed by the contests they undertake in the arena. There is a huge array of matches, perils, and foes that they might face, and the GM can present the players with a myriad of choices to keep the combats interesting and challenging for \ntheir characters. Since the Explorers must go about acquiring \nFavour to secure weapons, allies, and information, before they can escape, it is likely that they are called to enter the pits multiple times before they are free. Some of the matches can be short, brutal affairs with a single opponent and a few additional challenges or hazards to overcome. Others can be quite complex, involving dangerous environments, multiple foes, and elaborate victory conditions. The GM should try to create a mix of these, giving the PCs different obstacles to overcome and offering a chance for every member of their group to shine rather than just those who excel at combat.\nORGANISING A FIGHT\nWhen the Explorers are ﬁrst taken into captivity and they meet with Domos, it should be made clear to them by the Tech-Priest that to escape they need to gain Favour, so that they can acquire the means to make their break for freedom. Part of this is completing ﬁghts in the arena, which draws the attention of the Withered Blade and the crowd and allows \nthe PCs more privileges as gladiators. While the nature of a \ngiven ﬁght is out of the direct control of the Explorers (as \nit is determined by the GM), they can inﬂuence it in \ncertain ways if they so choose, via social interaction, \nthe expenditure of Favour, or a bit of both. The \nGM should create a number of set ﬁghts, either randomly generating them using the tables below or basing them on the abilities of the Explorers. Before a ﬁght is to commence, the GM can allow the Explorers to engage in some amount of skulduggery to shift the results to their advantage. They might try to sway the decisions of the Dark Eldar or secretly change them by stealth (altering records or switching the contents of a beasts cage, etc.). This sort of activity should require appropriate Skill Tests (the Explorers \nmight make a Charm Skill Test to convince Unarlan that an \nalternative match-up would be more exciting, or a Sleight \nof Hand Skill Test to rearrange the lots unnoticed), and \nhave logical consequences for failure. Success on such a Test \nallows the Explorers a re-roll on either Table 2–3: Arena \nFoes or Table 2–6: Arena Hazards.\nWhether or not the Explorers manipulate the composition \nof the arena combats, there are usually two major elements to a given battle in the pits: the foes the Explorers must ﬁght, and the hazards that the arena itself presents. The foes that the Dark Eldar throw at the Explorers come from an extensive array of other slaves, captured beasts, machines, and Dark Eldar warriors such as Wyches. There is no concept of fairness or any great design by the Dark Eldar when it comes to these ﬁghts, as they keep no scores. While other aliens may gamble on the outcome and the Dark Eldar might occasionally engage in such activities, they are largely uninterested in who wins and who dies, so long as someone suffers. There is a horrifying purity to the reason that the Dark Eldar stage \ntheir games: their sadistic need to witness the pain which the \ngladiators inﬂict and which they suffer in turn. As such, the \nWithered Blade Cult tries to throw opponents into the pit \ntogether with this in mind. Many times, though, the selection process is random, and as long as the ﬁght lasts for a decent amount of time, each side suffering wounds and spilling blood, the Dark Eldar ﬁnd it satisfying.\nThe perils of the arena are a way for the Dark Eldar \nto further enhance the carnage of the arena and draw out the agony of the ﬁghters. Without exception, all perils are included to make it more difﬁcult or dangerous for ﬁghters, forcing them to deal with the environment as much as they are dealing with their opponents. This can include a vast number of terrible contraptions, such as spiked pits and deadfalls, charged ﬁelds, walls of ﬂames, spinning bladed ﬂails, and spear traps. The Dark Eldar also enjoy altering the nature of the environment of the pits to make combats more deadly, adding knee deep water, manipulating the gravity (through \nthe Gaelan Sphere’s ancient mechanisms), or covering the \nﬂoor in burning, corrosive sand."

If he wants to make a ﬁght more challenging, he can increase the number of a selected foes the Explorers must face. The GM can also have the Explorers ﬁght more than one foe, rolling a second time on the table and applying both results to the combat. Combat with more than one type of foe adds signiﬁcantly to the difﬁculty of the combat, though larger ﬁghts could also become three-way combats as foes engage with each other even while they \nalso ﬁght the Explorers. A GM who wishes to challenge the \nExplorers might even roll multiple times on Table 2–3: \nArena Foes and increase the numbers of such foes, though \nthis could quickly become overwhelming for the PCs and more work for the GM. Alternately, if the GM wishes to make \na ﬁght easier, he might send the Explorers into the pit with \nNPC allies, to assist or to act as fodder for deadlier enemies.\nAlien Adversaries\nHuman slaves and Dark Eldar Wyches are not the only sentient adversaries the Explorers might face in the arena. Though it is rare, the Explorers can come face to face with all manner of xenos warriors, the most common of which would be Orks (there being an abundance of them in and around the Koronus Expanse), but which could also include any of the aliens of the Expanse. Typically, there should be one alien warrior for each Explorer if the Explorers are Rank 4 or lower, and two warriors for each Explorer if they are higher than Rank 4. Alternatively, if the Explorers are Rank 4 or higher, the aliens might be allowed to keep their original wargear while the Explorers are armed only with only Primitive or melee weapons and their ingenuity.\nProﬁles for the various aliens the Explorers might face, \nand the weapons they might use, can be found either in the fourth chapter (see page 96) of this volume or Chapter XIV: \nAdversaries and Aliens on page 364 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  \nCore Rulebook.\nBestial Foes\nThe Dark Eldar capture numerous beasts for their arena combats, going to great lengths to take vicious and deadly creatures alive so that they might pit them against each other and their slaves. The central location of the Nexus and the wealth of traders and travellers who pass though it mean that the Shadowspine Pits play host to a vast array of such beasts from across the Expanse and beyond. Anyalra’s beast cages are usually full of exotic ﬁends, and the GM can have the Dark Eldar produce almost any creature imaginable to face the Explorers (adding to the suspense as they wait in the pit, nervously eyeing the gravity doors and wondering just what new horror might appear).\nThe GM can roll on Table 2–4: Unleash the Beasts, \nor, if the GM has other Rogue Trader books with beasts \nin them, such as K\nORONUS  BESTIARY , he can use these as \nsources for alternate monsters.\nTable 2—3: Arena Foes\nTable 2—3: Arena Foes\n1d10 Roll Foes\n1d10 Roll Foes\n1\n NPC Opponents\n2–3\n Dark Eldar Wyches\n4–5\n Bestial Opponent\n6–7\n Alien Adversaries\n8–9\n Pit Drudges\n10\n PC Opponent\nTable 2—4: Unleash the beasts\nTable 2—4: Unleash the beasts\n1d10 Roll Foes\n1d10 Roll Foes\n1–2\nOne Khymerae for each Explorer (and one additional Khymerae for each Explorer Rank 5 or higher). \nSee page 134 for the Khymera proﬁle.\n3–4\nOne Ariadne Helspider for each Explorer (and one additional Ariadne Helspider for each Explorer Rank \n5 or higher).

The Wyches of the Withered Blade are extremely skilled killers, and they reﬁne their art in the pits. As a result, ﬁghts against the Dark Eldar should always be difﬁcult, as the Explorers are outnumbered and poorly armed. These combats are not insurmountable, however. As much as the Dark Eldar enjoy slaughter, they also like to see their slaves put on a good show of blood and death, and they accept they must cull the weakest of their own in the crucible of the pit. When creating a match against the Dark Eldar, the \nGM can choose from the various kinds of Dark Eldar found in \nChapter IV: The Twisted Path. Groups of opponents should vary from ﬁght to ﬁght, along with the arena perils, to create interesting and diverse challenges for the Explorers. If the GM does not wish to create groups of Dark Eldar on his own, he can roll on Table 2–5: Dark Eldar Opponents to generate groups of foes for the Explorers.\nNPC Opponent\nAt least one of the Explorers is likely to have to face one or more of the other slave gladiators from the Withered Blade slave pens. The GM can use these combats to either settle scores (giving the PCs a chance to kill off NPCs who are causing them problems with their escape) or as part of the machinations for the Dark Eldar and the other slaves (jealous or hateful NPCs or cunning Dark Eldar might pit them against newfound allies). These ﬁghts do not need to be to the death, however, and the Explorers can make plans with Domos to resuscitate or repair NPCs after such combats. Whether or not the Explorers want to ﬁght to the NPCs they have been set against, these \ncan be some of the most dangerous duels they undertake, as \nmany of the NPCs possess skills on par with their own. When selecting NPCs to engage the PCs, the GM should consider \nthe Explorers’ escape plans, the alliances they have already \nmade with the other slaves, and whether or not they \nhave made enemies within the Withered Blade who \nmight work against them. Most NPCs should be \naccompanied by several appropriate nameless NPCs, though powerhouses like Ludvos Tarn could likely face most groups of Explorers without help.Details on the skills and ﬁghting style of each of the major NPC captives of the Withered Blade can be found above in the Brothers in Blood section, while their proﬁles and additional information can be found on page 58.\nPC Opponent\nJust as it is possible for the Explorers to face NPCs in the arena, they might ﬁnd themselves thrown against each other for the amusement of the Dark Eldar. These kinds of ﬁghts can be interesting for both the players and GM, as it gives them a chance to test the skills of their characters against each other without destabilising the group. These kinds of ﬁghts should be one-on-one, so as not to confuse matters or lead to \nExplorers ganging up on each other, as this could easily lead \nto dangerous imbalances in group dynamics. It remains up to \nthe PCs whether they intend to truly try and kill each other \nor simply put on a show to placate the Dark Eldar. In the \nlatter case, the GM should reward the PCs with an additional Favour if they do manage to work together and use their respective abilities to “stage” an impressive ﬁght without the need for either to die. However, even if the two coordinate to survive the ﬁght together, blood still needs to be spilled and some degree of pain inﬂicted.\nPit Drudges\nThere are thousands of slaves within the Shadowspine Pits under the control of the Withered Blade, and though the majority are not worthy of the title of gladiator, they are still sent to the arenas to die at the hands of skilled warriors and rabid beasts. The Explorers might ﬁnd themselves facing such a horde of pit slaves, given rudimentary weapons and sent against them in what is almost certainly to be a slaughter. The majority of pit slaves are humans, \ntaken from worlds within the Koronus Expanse or on the \nedge of the Calixis Sector in raids, and could even come from the ranks of the Explorers’ home worlds or vessels. These combats are not likely to present the Explorers with \nTable 2—5: Dark Eldar Opponents\n1d10 Roll Foes\n1–2\nOne Hekatrix Bloodbride and one Wych for each Explorer (or one Hekatrix Bloodbride for each Explorer \nRank 5 or higher).

To make an encounter with pit slaves more challenging, the GM could leave several Chrono-gladiators lurking in their midst (see \npage 132 for the proﬁle for Chrono-gladiators). While \nthese terrifying warriors are far more powerful than the \nwretched dredges around them, their power would likely \nnot become apparent until it was too late. Pit slaves can also be used alongside the Explorers when facing some of \nthe larger and nastier creatures of the arena, allowing the \nGM to show the Explorers “how the monster works” with the fresh corpses of scores of screaming humans before unleashing its full fury upon them.\nThe GM can use proﬁles (Anguished Eldar, Brutalised \nTau Fire Warrior, Tormented Human) found on pages 128-129 in Chapter IV: The Treacherous Path. Most groups \nof Explorers Rank 4 or lower should be able to handle one to two of these wretches per Explorer, and groups of Rank 5 or higher can ﬁght larger groups, especially if they come into possession of ranged weapons of any sort. Of course, gunning down pit drudges is hardly a challenge, and such a fate is too merciful for Dark Eldar tastes.\nGLADIATORIAL  W EAPONS  AND ARMOUR\nThe weapons, armour, and gear the Explorers can take with \nthem into the arena is up to the GM, though he should allow them to inﬂuence their equipment through the use of Favour. At least in their ﬁrst combats, they are restricted to what the Dark Eldar choose to give them, usually the scraps from weapons taken during their raids on human and alien worlds. This can be almost anything, from poorly made autoguns with \nrusted ammo and scrap metal fashioned into knives to arcane \nxenos blades and ancient but ill-functioning plasma guns. The \nGM should bear in mind that the Dark Eldar want to see as \nmuch carnage as possible during their arena combats, and so \ngenerally restrict weapons that are excessively powerful or capable of quickly slaying a foe. Instead they prefer weapons that wound or require repeated use to kill. They also prefer to give combatants melee weapons and primitive weapons over guns and advanced ﬁrearms, drawing out the process of killing and ensuring that as much blood is split as is possible.\nArmour is also often restricted, since it exists to limit \nthe amount of blood drawn in a conﬂict, and though the Explorers may be able to use their Favour to gain some rudimentary protection, it is likely that the Dark Eldar toss them to the arena with only the clothes on their backs (crafty and opportunistic Explorers may be able to scavenge, create, or steal better armour from fallen foes, and the Dark Eldar will usually allow slaves to keep some amount of personalised \narmour even though they strip their slaves of any weapons \nthat they can ﬁnd when they leave the arenas.\nApart from the use of Favour to gain better weapons and \narmour for their combats, the Explorers can always choose to eschew any ranged weapons they are given, choosing to take melee weapons instead, thus providing a better show for their dark masters and gaining more Favour (as detailed above) to aid them in their escape. Further, the GM can use access (or the lack of access) to more powerful weapons and armour to regulate the difﬁculty of the Explorers’ encounters in the pits.\nHAZARDS  OF THE ARENA\nIn addition to selecting one or more foes for the Explorers to ﬁght, the GM can also create the arena environment. While it is not mandatory that every arena have hazards, and some can be fought on the simple steel and sand at the bottom of the pit, using the perils makes the ﬁghts more memorable and keeps them interesting as the PCs gradually gain the Favour they need to escape. The GM can either roll on Table 2–6: \nArena Hazards or choose one of the results from those presented below. Arena perils affect the whole arena and impede the PCs and their foes as described in their entries, usually indiscriminately. The GM can also add multiple \nperils to an arena in the same way as he can add multiple \nfoes. Unlike foes, however, perils are relatively predictable in their effects, and though they increase the difﬁculty of a combat in some ways, they also create new opportunities for the Explorers that may make an unlikely victory against an overwhelming foe possible. Some perils are designed to work together and can creating interesting effects when combined. The Dark Eldar are well aware of this fact and are happy to exploit it. Individual descriptions handle the effects of combined hazards."

When mixed with the sand, these chemicals are difﬁcult to detect—until the ﬁghters smell the burning soles of their boots (or feet). An arena (or some portions of it, depending on the whim of the Dark Eldar) with the Burning Sand hazard is corrosive to walk on, either because of its temperature or some toxic element which eats through the combatants’ boots. After spending two consecutive Rounds of combat in a Burning Sand area, a combatant must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer one point of Energy Damage without reduction for Armour or Toughness to any body part that is in contact with \nthe searing sand. Those wearing armoured boots (i.e. those \nwho have Armour Points on their legs) gain a +10 to this Test \nfor every AP their Armour provides, but also lose a point off the \nArmour on their legs even if they pass the Test. After another \ntwo Rounds of combat (four Rounds after entering the area), the Test becomes a Very Hard (–30) Toughness Test as the combatants’ footwear is burned away by the blistering heat or chemicals. Combatants who are knocked down on a patch of Burning Sand must make an immediate Toughness Test or suffer 1d5 Energy Damage without reduction for Armour or Toughness, and lose a point of Armour on every location on their body. If there are patches of Burning Sand mixed into a largely normal arena, combatants may make a Very Hard \n(–30) Perception Test to detect if a speciﬁc area is caustic or not (this Test becomes Routine (+20) if the Explorer is already standing in the area in question.\nBurning Sands does not work in conjunction \nwith Liquid Hazard (the liquids quench \nthe chemicals in the sand), \nbut when combined \nwith Gravity Flux \nor Skyfall, ﬁll the air with clouds of corrosive dust, making sections of the arena extremely hazardous (combatants entering these \nclouded areas count as if they had been knocked down in the \nBurning Sands for the turn they are in them). The GM can \neither have these dust clouds stationary, marking them out \nfor the PCs, or have them move about, randomly checking each turn to see if one descends on an Explorer (this can be resolved by randomly selecting a combatant, and then allowing him a Dodge Test to avoid the cloud).\nCloak of Night\nArenas covered by the Cloak of Night are pitch black or shrouded in shadows and it becomes practically impossible to see anything. Treat the arena as an area of total darkness (see pages 247 and 268 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  \nCore Rulebook) with all the penalties and dangers that accompany these conditions. Sound and smell become even more important to the Explorers in these situations, and they must move slowly and cautiously to ﬁnd their foes and then strike out blindly at them hoping to land a telling blow. This hazard can be made even more murderous if the Dark Eldar pit the Explorers against a creature with the Dark Sight Trait, or Dark Eldar with xenos devices allowing them to pierce the shadow ﬁeld’s inky veil.\nThe Cloak of Night can work well with most of the other \nperils, and especially ones such as Dragon’s Breath or Lightning \nField, as the discharges of ﬁre and electricity can provide brief \nillumination while also presenting danger. Spikes and Blades is \nalso extremely dangerous when used with the Cloak of Night \nas it becomes even more difﬁcult to detect the traps and pitfalls, \nimposing a –30 penalty on Tests to detect or Dodge their attacks. A Cloak of Night completely overrides the effects of a Maze of Shadows, as nobody can see the tenebrous paths that it creates.\nDragon’s Breath\nThere are countless tunnels, pipes, and conduits within the Gaelan Sphere all feeding its great machines and devices. Some of these have been converted by the Dark Eldar to spew their deadly contents into the ﬁghting pits. Dragon’s Breath is such a peril, and though it usually takes the form of columns of ﬁre, it can also represent streams of acid, toxic sludge, or scalding steam. Every Round before combatants take their actions, there is a chance that one of these openings vomits forth its deadly breath into the arena, affecting a random area 2d10 metres in diameter (the GM can use the Scatter table on page 248 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook to determine \nthis location, using the centre of the arena as a starting point). Combatants in the affected area can make a Dodge Test to avoid the burst of ﬂame, sludge, steam or acid, thus avoiding harm. Those who fail suffer 2d10 Energy Damage and, depending on the nature of the discharge, may have a chance of being set on ﬁre. As a further complication, Explorers and \ntheir opponents can try to use the \nexhaust points of the Dragon’s \nBreath to their advantage. \nFighters can make a \nChallenging (+0) \nLogic or Tech-Use \nTable 2—6: Arena Hazards\n1d10 Roll Hazard\n1\n Burning Sand\n2\n Cloak of Night\n3\n Dragon’s Breath\n4\n Gravity Flux \n5\n Lightning Field\n6\n Liquid Hazard\n7\n Maze of Shadows\n8\n Scrap Yard\n9\n Skyfall\n10\n Spikes and Blades\n to detect if a speciﬁc area is caustic \nor not (this Test becomes Routine (+20) if the Explorer is \nalready standing in the area in question.\nBurning Sands does not work in conjunction \nwith Liquid Hazard (the liquids quench \nthe chemicals in the sand), \nbut when combined \nwith Gravity Flux \nor Skyfall, ﬁll \nharm.

When combined with the Scrap Yard peril, Explorers can use the wealth of wreckage in the arena to stopper up an exhaust port and protect that area. This requires a Full Action and an Ordinary (+10) Strength Test. If the Dragon’s Breath then issues forth from their area, the junk clogs the port, preventing the discharge.\nGravity Flux\nThe Shadowspine Pits were originally intended as pathways into the Sphere’s fusion core for asteroids and other space debris. To aid in the snaring and transportation of these materials, each pit was ringed with gravity harpoons and suspensor ﬁelds so its ancient builders could manipulate the movement of the \nobjects on their journey to be melted down into fuel and \nbuilding materials. While most of the machinery of the pits is now inactive or disabled by the Dark Eldar, the aliens do still employ the suspensor ﬁelds for some of their combats. This allows them to alter the gravity within the pit, increasing it to weigh combatants down and make them struggle to raise their weapon, or reducing it to enable the ﬁghters to leap about the arena in long strides or to ensure that the recoil of their weapons hurls them backwards. At the start of the combat, the GM can choose to have the Dark Eldar set the gravity to either high or low for the duration of the ﬁght, or alternatively each Round the GM decide randomly whether it remains the same or switches. See The Effects of Gravity on page 269 of the  \nR\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook for details on how different \ngravities affect the Explorers and their opponents.\nGravity Flux can work with most of the other perils \nwithout impeding their function, though it might create some unusual effects, like creating suspended globes of liquid that smash down with hurricane force a moment later in a Liquid Hazard, or causing spears and arrows from Spikes and \nBlades to travel shorter or longer distances. When used with \nthe Scrap Yard hazard, it can cause junk to move around if the gravity shifts from high to low or vice versa, and Explorers might ﬁnd themselves scrabbling out of newly made ﬁre-lanes as cover ﬂoats away or being forced to dodge out of the way as a pile of twisted metal suddenly topples over.\nLightning Field\nDark Eldar, like their Craftworld kin, are supremely skilled in the manufacture and operation of ﬁeld technology, and are able to manipulate energies with a ﬁnesse and subtlety that few humans even dream of possessing. The ﬁelds they use to cloak the arenas in darkness are an example of this mastery, but they can also use it to create areas of the arena charged with electrical energy. Illuminated by arcing light, these appear as a chequerboard of shapes on the pit ﬂoor that periodically move and shift, forcing the ﬁghters to \nconstantly relocate along with them lest they be caught by the deadly charge. The GM should divide the arena up \ninto a grid, or a similar set of shapes numbered 1–10. At the start of each Round, he should roll 1d10 three times. Each number that the GM rolls on these dice causes the corresponding area of the grid to activate. For example, if the GM rolls 3, 5, and 7, the squares with those numbers activate (duplicate rolls are discarded). The charge can actually be seen moving, so ﬁghters have a chance to get \nout of the way, if they can make a successful Challenging \n(+0) Dodge Test and they are near enough to the edge of \nthe affected section. Those caught in the Lightning Field suffer 2d10 E Damage with the Shocking Quality.\nA Lightning Field is especially deadly when used with a \nLiquid Hazard, as many kinds of liquid conduct electricity and spread it over a much wider area. In this case, the entire arena is affected by the Lightning Field, but its Damage is reduced to 1d10 Energy Damage with the Shocking Quality. The other slight advantage to the presence of water is that if a ﬁghter can somehow get above the water (such as standing on a large corpse or debris from the Scrap Yard hazard, provided it is not conductive), he is not affected by the ﬁeld even if he is in the section where it has appeared, the water dissipating the crackling energy below him.\nLiquid Hazard\nFilling a pit with liquid, either water or some similar ﬂuid, is another favoured trick of the Dark Eldar. Knee or waist deep water impedes movement, and makes Charging and Running impossible. It also grants concealment to waterborne creatures. Water also brings with it the danger of drowning, something that the Explorers and their opponents can use against each other if they choose. The GM can choose to have the liquid be \nshallow (in which case it counts as a Treacherous Environment, \nas described on Table 9–32: Agility Modiﬁers for Running \nThrough Treacherous Environments on page 266 of the \nR\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook), or as waist or chest deep \nwater (in which case he can use the rules for Swimming from \npage 267 of the ROGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook). If it is deep \nwater, then there are likely islands (possibly peaks of junk from a Scrap Yard) on which ﬁghters can try to defend themselves, though as the ﬁght progresses the water may rise, especially if there is some aquatic horror the gladiators must ﬁght, perched on their islands and watching its fangs and tentacles \ngetting closer and closer. The GM can also have the water \nbe dangerous in its own right, whether it is deep or shallow, and it can represent sewage, putreﬁed corpses or noxious chemicals. In addition to the normal rules, a Liquid Hazard with this unpleasant addition makes all attacks count as having the Toxic Quality as wounds burn with its vile ﬂuids.\nFor a truly surreal encounter, the GM can combine \na Liquid Hazard with Skyfall to create a vortex of water spheres wobbling and drifting around the pit. Explorers must ﬂy or swim their way from one side to the other and some water spheres might contain aquatic beasts, lashing out against those who come too close."

      "text": "68\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nMaze of Shadows\nDark Eldar enjoy tormenting their slaves not just with physical \npain, but also by twisting their minds and subjecting them to psychological attacks. It gives them much pleasure to see slaves blundering about unsure of their fate. The Maze of Shadows is a specially constructed maze that is layered over a ﬁghting pit, forcing the ﬁghters to ﬁnd their way to each other while trying to avoid becoming lost. From above, the spectators can see where all the combatants are, and take great amusement watching them wander past each other unaware or taking turns that lead them into the waiting blades of their foes. The GM can represent the Maze of Shadows in one of two ways: either by drawing an actual maze (the full layout of which he keeps secret) or having the Explorers make Intelligence Tests to ﬁnd their way through the twisting paths. If the GM draws a map, he can have the Explorers choose their path from \nturn to turn until they blunder into their opponents, and then \nuse the map if the combat turns into a running battle, with foes striking and running away to hide or lay ambushes. The simpler method is to represent the maze as a challenge which must be overcome for the Explorers to ﬁnd their way. As a part of any Movement Action, an Explorer may make a Difﬁcult (–10) Intelligence or Perception Test or a Ordinary (+10) \nTracking, Navigation (Surface), or Logic Test which, \nif passed, allows the Explorer to either ﬁnd another PC or ally, or uncover an enemy. If the Explorer fails, he blunders around lost for his Turn. In both, cases the GM should have the Explorers enter the maze from different points.\nThe Maze of Shadows works especially well with Spikes and \nBlades, where the dead ends, blind corners, and twisting passages are perfect for hiding traps. In these conditions, Explorers suffer \na –10 penalty to their Dodge Tests to avoid these traps.\nScrap Yard\nThe Nexus of Shadows has no shortage of junk and debris \nscattered across its surface and ﬁlling its chambers and tunnels. This is the result of centuries of neglect and decay as well as the battles fought by the Dark Eldar against its automated defences. The Withered Blade Cult sometimes uses this junk to create unstable and dangerous platforms for their arena battles, covering the ﬂoor of a pit with twisted metal and broken rubble. Fighting in such conditions means clambering over bent girders and crawling \nthrough rusted tunnels of scrap to get to foes, or hiding in among \nthe rubble to set off ambushes. The Scrap Yard counts as Rubble \n(see page 266 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook) and also \nprovides 8 Armour Points of cover against ranged attacks due to \nits numerous barricades and wrecks. The GM can also allow an Explorer to try to scavenge from the Scrap Yard as a Full Action, making a Search Skill Test to ﬁnd an something of use. What the Explorers ﬁnd is up to the GM, but they can dig up almost anything, such as examples of Imperial personal weaponry, partially functioning servitors, or components that can be turned into arms or explosives with the Tech-Use Skill.\nIf the Dark Eldar combine the Burning Sands and \nScrap Yard hazards, the Explorers gains a +20 \nbonus to any Toughness Tests made to avoid \nbeing seared by the chemicals in the sands in \nanywhere the two overlap.Skyfall\nJust as the Dark Eldar are able to manipulate the gravity of a pit to make it heavier or lighter, they can also negate the gravity altogether. When they decide such twist is in order, the Dark Eldar usually open the base of the pit, so that the ﬁghters might battle in mid-air above a seemingly bottomless shaft with a fearsome eerie glow somewhere in the distance (the Gaelan Sphere’s fusion core). Above, a repulsion ﬁeld prevents combatants from drifting off out of the arena and into the stands or beyond, but below there is nothing to stop them being hurled down the shaft. Combats in zero gravity usually involve opponents that can ﬂy or are dextrous enough to push themselves off from one edge of the pit to another and make attacks, though it does sometimes amuse the Dark Eldar to send in a land-bound beast and watch it thrash about, biting and clawing at anyone with the bad luck to drift too \nnear. The rules for movement in zero gravity can be found on \npage 269 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook. \nCombining Scrap Yard with Skyfall can make for an \ninteresting combat, as it is akin to ﬁghting in a miniature asteroid ﬁeld; pieces of twisted metal and torn wreckage swirl around the ﬁghters, obscuring vision, providing temporary cover, and generally changing the face of the battleﬁeld without warning. The junk provides cover as normal, and can additionally be used to aid movement, giving the ﬁghters extra objects and surfaces to push off from or stop their weightless leaps. \nSpikes and Blades\nArenas are often ﬁlled with ﬁendish and gruesome traps to add to the danger of the ﬁghts, and kill or maim the unwary. These come in a myriad of shapes and sizes, but usually involve hidden blades or sprung spears, arrows, and spikes. Anyone who wanders into such a trap only has a moment’s warning before blades suddenly spring up from the pit ﬂoor or shoot out from the wall. At the beginning of the ﬁght, the GM \nshould place a number of secret traps equal to the number of \ncombatants in the arena, marking their location such that it is \nknown only to him. At the beginning of each Explorer’s turn, \nhe may make a Challenging (+0) Awareness Test as a Free \nAction or a Routine (+20) Search Test as a Half Action to \ntry to detect any traps within a number of metres equal to his Perception Bonus. Traps may be disarmed with an Ordinary \n(+10) Security Test made as a Half Action or traversed with a Challenging (+0) Acrobatics Test. Additionally, a the \nattacks that traps trigger may be Dodged if the Explorer is aware of the trap. If an Explorer is hit by the trap, he suffers 2d10+2 Rending Damage to a random location. Some traps are also be poisoned (at the GM’s discretion), gaining the Toxic Quality. Once a trap has been triggered, it has no effect for the remainder of the encounter."

      "text": "69\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nII: Blood, Sand & Steel\nA GAME WITHIN A GAME\nFavour is a way in which the GM can track the Explorers’ \nprogress without the need to go into great details as to the how and why of it all. However, the arena is a hotbed of politics, and countless powerful and inﬂuential individuals grace its pits. It also has a pivotal place within the power \nstruggles of the Nexus. If the GM so desires, he can ﬂesh out \nthe arena by adding more NPCs, creating additional Dark Eldar nobles along with their own plots and plans, or using \nsome of those from Finding an Enemy. It is entirely possible \nthat an aspiring Dark Eldar noble, such as Ravyr Dysk from \nthe ﬁrst chapter, might have his own designs on the position \nof Archon of the Nexus and try to use the Explorers to undermine his enemies. The GM can have the Explorers come across information about such power-hungry xenos and use it to their advantage, trying to inﬂame their ambitions or ire by thwarting their plans or framing their rivals.\nSLAVES  OF THE W ITHERED  HOUSE\nAs important the struggles and spilled blood in the pits are, the thousands of slaves who wait on the Dark Eldar and their honoured guests are not without signiﬁcance, even if each one is highly expendable. These are the slaves who keep the city alive and thrumming with trade and productivity, undertaking all the jobs that the aliens would never lower themselves to perform or consider ﬁt for beings of their dread lineage. Within the tunnels and chambers below the ﬁghting pits, the Withered Blade household sprawls out to the edges of the Nexus of Shadows and down numerous levels deep into the \nshell of the Gaelan Sphere. When the Wyches of the Cult are \nnot training, ﬁghting, or watching ﬁghts within the pits, it is \nhere that they conduct their business and pass their time with \ndark amusements. Anyalra has cultivated a domain of hedonism and excess in which Dark Eldar from far and wide across the Nexus of Shadows and beyond frequently indulge, and it is her desire that any who come to the Shadowspine Pits should ﬁnd whatever vice they desire, that she might forge strong alliances and trade for the best gladiators for her pits.\nThe House of the Withered Blade is a nightmarish place, \nwhere life is cheap and pain is a currency exchanged by capricious aliens like coin. To survive and prosper in such an environment, the Explorers need to be cunning and careful, keeping themselves out of harm’s way while completing their objectives. Their position in the house also brings with it unique opportunities, as the PCs potentially have access to the Dark Eldar nobles and their guests, who have information that can greatly aid the group in their escape attempt. From their \nposition in the house, they can also inﬂuence the kinds of games \nand combats in which they may ﬁght, even gaining the ear of one or more of the Dark Eldar and using this favour to send weapons and specialised equipment into the slave pens. When the time comes to make a bid for freedom, those Explorers who have excelled at serving in a household are uniquely placed to open portals, lower barriers, and subvert defence systems.\nHIERARCHY  OF THE PITS\nIn the arena, opponents are judged by their prowess in combat. Every foe the Explorers face is likely intent only on their personal destruction. In the household of the Withered Blade, opponents can come in many forms, and their power and inﬂuence is judged by their position in Dark Eldar society or \ntheir standing with Anyalra as well as by their combat abilities. \nTo win Favour and get the materials and tools needed to make an escape, the Explorers must also overcome these opponents, or turn them against each other for their own ends. Each foe has particular strengths and weaknesses, which the Explorers must uncover and exploit. These foes can be combined with the encounters detailed in Dark Pastimes to complicate otherwise \nstraightforward encounters. Not all the adversaries are Dark Eldar, either, and the Explorers may ﬁnd that a slave is far more dangerous to their plans than one of their captors.\nFINDING  AN ENEMY\nThe GM can choose a personality from amongst the ones below and combine him or her with any encounter from Table 2–7: \nDark Pastimes on page 70 to create opportunities or obstacles for the Explorers serving in the household of the Withered Blade to overcome in order to gain Favour. As with combat encounters, \nthe difﬁculty of overcoming a social challenge should dictate how \nmuch Favour it awards, with additional unforeseen complication also increasing the ultimate reward for success.\nObedhiaus Fyst (Human Slave)\nScarred and bitter, Fyst has been a slave of the Withered Blade for many years and worked his way up into a position of prominence among their human captives. His meaty ﬁsts and thick brow hide a cunning intelligence and a strong will to survive no matter the cost. Despite the tortures he has undergone at the hands of the Dark Eldar, he has a twisted kind of loyalty to them, like a whipped dog, eager to please even if it means more pain from his masters. He is a dangerous opponent for the Explorers, as he notices many things to which the Dark Eldar themselves pay no heed, and he might \nseek to stop the PCs if they threaten the Cult of the Withered \nBlade. Fyst also has many of the other human slaves under \nhis control, who are nearly as afraid of the scarred slave as of \nthe Dark Eldar. Obedhiaus Fyst uses the proﬁle given for a Tormented Human on page 128, but with a +5 bonus to all of his Characteristics and training in the Intimidate Skill.\nReave-Captain Coronnia (Human)\nA close ally of the Kasballica crime bosses of Footfall, Coronnia has been trading slaves and xenos artefacts as part of the Cold Trade for many years, though only recently has she started visiting the Nexus. It is possible that the Explorers might know something of Coronnia, or have allies and enemies in common with her, and she might well know them. Regardless, she has taken to the life of the Dark Eldar and enjoys the pleasures they can offer, along with the cold hard coin in slaves she makes for each trip. She might well recognise the worth of the Explorers and want to buy them, ransoming them back to their dynasty, or removing them from the \npicture on behalf of their enemies. She is smug and arrogant, \nand enjoys seeing the Explorers suffer, having suffered at the hands of Rogue Traders in the past. Coronnia uses the proﬁle given for a Void Pirate Captain on page 373 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook."

His shaved head and unmarred face bear a number of tattoos of dedication to the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, and he wears a distinctive suit of armour adorned with the bones of countless victims. Cruel and ﬁckle, Nyr likes to test his combat skills or wet his blades on any slaves that wander too near should the mood take him, usually in the pits where all can see. He is a dangerous and unpredictable element that the Explorers must deal with, and can complicate any of their plans. The only way to placate the sadistic noble is to offer him some sport or diversion he ﬁnds amusing, inevitably involving the spilling of blood. Many slaves have suffered lasting scars \nat the hands of Nyr and it would take little prodding to get \nthem to exact their vengeance on him. Dyrac Nyr uses the proﬁle given for a Kabalite Trueborn on page 123, but with his Weapon Skill and Strength Characteristics increased by +15. He is equipped with suit of ghostplate armour (see page 115).\nHobhyoos Gies (Stryxis)\nAmong the customers of the Withered Blade is Hobhyoos Gies, a Stryxis merchant and slaver from the depths of the Koronus Expanse who is notorious for having told Zaergarn Kul the location of The Soul Reaver. Small for a Stryxis, Gies stands \nconsiderably shorter than most of the Explorers. Many slaves who ﬁnd their way to the remote alien empires and renegade human worlds of the Koronus Expanse come through Gies, and \nthe greedy alien has his hands in many pockets when it comes \nto the slave trade. However, this is not his true purpose on the \nNexus of Shadows. Gies may treat with the Dark Eldar of the \nCult, but his mysterious hatred of the Eldar burns as hot as \nin any of his ilk. The Explorers can sway Gies with sufﬁcient promises of the artefacts that the Stryxis hoard, but can also appeal to his shrouded but potent desire to see his hosts—and the entire Nexus of Shadows—burn.\nUnarlan (Dark Eldar)\nUnarlan is a Hekatrix Bloodbride in the service of Anyalra, and oversees most of the Cult of the Withered Blade’s daily affairs, from keeping the slaves in line to seeing that the guests of the house are kept comfortable (and monitored). Unarlan wears the customary armour of the Withered Blade’s Hekatrix Bloodbrides, but can easily be spotted from a distance by her shock of white hair, which stands in contrast to dark tones of her armour. If the Explorers want to get access to control \narrays to aid their escape, then they likely need to deal with \nUnarlan, though she has little time for slaves and is quick to \nuse her favoured agoniser lash. Her ﬁrst and foremost duty is \nto her Succubus, and this is where the Explorers might gain \nsome leverage. If they can convince her that Anyalra would \nfavour an action or that the mistress of the Withered \nBlade might punish a lapse of duty, they might ﬁnd \nan opening to get information from her. Unarlan \ncan never be openly threatened or blackmailed \nby a mere slave (her response is swift and violent), so if the Explorers wish to pursue a plan involving her, they need to be subtle. Unarian uses the proﬁle given for a Hekatrix Bloodbride in Chapter IV: The Treacherous Path on page 124, but her Weapon Skill and Strength \nCharacteristics are increased by +15. She is equipped with a Best Quality agoniser lash and a Common Quality mindphase gauntlet (see pages 112-114).\nSERV ICE T O THE WICKED\nThe cult of the Withered Blade is a cesspit of hedonism and excess where the Dark Eldar indulge in all manner of vile pastimes. Like the battles in the arena, these depraved forms of entertainment are largely focused on the harvesting of pain to fuel the Dark Eldar’s hunger for the agony of others, and the \ndespicable aliens never seem to tire of tormenting their slaves. \nThey are also adept at putting on shows for visitors, both alien and human, in the course of buying and selling slaves and xenos goods. These displays can take many different forms depending on the whims and desires of their guests, but the Dark Eldar are usually more than accommodating when it comes to sacriﬁcing a few slaves for everyone’s amusement (not including that of the slaves in question, of course).\nThe GM should use the encounters from Table 2–7: Dark \nPastimes to create challenges for the Explorers in the same way he creates arena combats for those ﬁghting in the pits. Completing these encounters can either reward the Explorers with Favour (which they can then use as a generic commodity to gain the materials they need to escape) or if the PCs have a speciﬁc goal in mind, an encounter can be used as the \nchallenge required to complete a particular goal. All of the \nencounters can use one or more of the NPCs from Finding \nan Enemy on page 69, pitting the Explorers against one of \nthe other slaves, guests, or masters of the household.\nBLOODY  HUNT\nThe Explorers are told by their captors that they must descend \ninto the tunnels beneath the Withered Blade’s holdings (under the guard of a group of their captors) and participate in a hunt. Unarlan, who leads the cadre of Wyches observing the affair informs the Explorers that they can either ﬁnd and slay a worthy creature, or else become the prey of the Wyches themselves. The Explorers’ quarry can be any of the arena beasts presented in this book (see Beasts of the Arena \non page 132), or alternatively, any other appropriate xenos \ncreature that might dwell deep within the Gaelan Sphere. \nTo ﬁnd the creature, Explorers need to successfully use the \nTable 2—7: Dark Pastimes\nTable 2—7: Dark Pastimes\n1d10 Roll Event\n1-2\n Bloody Hunt\nBloody Hunt\n3\n Never Split the Party\nNever Split the Party\n4-6\n Conﬂict of Interests\nConﬂict of Interests\n7\n A Game of Blame\nA Game of Blame\n8\n The Sphere Stirs\nThe Sphere Stirs\n9-10\n Specialised Expertise\nSpecialised Expertise"

Making an impressive kill is worth a single point of Favour, but the dead beast does not speak for itself. Once they have killed the creature and brought it back, the Explorers must use their knowledge and \nsocial Skills to present the creature and the tale of the pain that \nthey inﬂicted upon it (or suffered themselves while slaying it). \nIf they can impress their jaded captors at all with the creature \nthey ﬁnd, the Explorers earn another two Favour.\nNEVER  SPLIT THE PARTY\nOne of the Explorers has caught the eye of a slaver, and the Dark Eldar have begun negotiating to have the Explorer sold off and sent back to some remote world in the Koronus Expanse (presumably to live out a miserable life working mines or harvesting toxic ﬁelds). The Explorers need to stop the sale somehow, either by presenting the buyer with a more suitable purchase or making the PC in question seem ﬂawed in some way. Knowledge and Fellowship-based Skills are crucial here, and the Explorers must Deceive and Charm their way through the challenge, possibly even engineering demonstrations of their \ncomrade’s “unworthiness.” This can be a dangerous game, as if \nthey make their fellow Explorer seem too worthless, he might be thrown into the arena as pit fodder. If they fail to dissuade the buyer (or accidentally convince the Cult of the Withered Blade that their friend would make better nourishment for a Clawed Fiend than a slave), the Explorers must call in debts, expending three Favour to manipulate events in the arena such that their companion is not lost. Favour spent this way does not count towards the total required to escape the pits. The Explorers earn two Favour if they can overcome this challenge without diminishing their position by spending Favour.\nCONFLICT  OF INTERESTS\nThe Explorers are ordered by one of the guests of the Withered Blade, or a lesser captain or noble, to do something which goes directly against what they have been told by Anyalra. This could be entering a forbidden zone, removing an item without permission, or even killing another slave. The Explorers must decide how to complete the task without Anyalra and the rest of the Withered Blade discovering it or must turn down the individual giving the order in a way which does not invoke immediate retribution. Clever PCs can turn this to their advantage and frame or blackmail the individual, \nor try to gain Favour from Anyalra by turning him in.\nA G AME  OF BLAME\nSomething has been stolen, a slave has been killed or damaged \nwithout the Dark Eldar’s consent, or there has been a trespass into a forbidden area. Whether or not the Explorers are connected or responsible for this infraction, they must try to move the blame to another in some convincing way, such as planting evidence or extracting a false confession. Investigative Skills such as Inquiry and Interrogation are key to revealing the truth, while social Skills like Deceive and Intimidate are crucial to obscuring it. If the Explorers can successfully pass the blame \nto another individual or party (justly or not), they gain one \nFavour. If they can put the blame on an enemy or otherwise turn events to their advantage, the Explorers gain two Favour and might even be able to remove an opponent or obstacle. If they fail to implicate somebody else, however, the Explorers suffer the punishment for the transgression and, what’s more, lose two Favour as their standing falls. Favour lost this way does \nnot count toward the total required for their escape.\nTHE SPHERE  STIRS\nThe systems that once controlled the Gaelan Sphere’s \noperations within the Shadowspine Pits have been all but stamped out, but a few glimmers and tendrils of the Sphere’s inﬂuence remain, in cracked consoles and damaged panels sporadically provided with the power to operate. Other \nslaves have mentioned feeling the presence of the Sphere \nwhile completing their duties, and using this information the \nExplorers can try to trace the tendrils of its power and ﬁnd \na place where they can tap into it within the pits. This likely requires the PCs entering forbidden zones and sneaking or \ntricking their way past Dark Eldar guards, or using others \nto secretly do their work. If they can ﬁnd an active conduit to the governing systems of the Gaelan Sphere, they can use it to learn vast amounts of information about the ancient infrastructure underlying the Shadowspine Pits, and perhaps even manipulate some of the systems within the pits to their own ends. They must slip past one patrol of Wyches either by stealth or trickery, navigate their way to a console, and make a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test to access its knowledge. \nIt takes a number of minutes equal to ten minus the sum of Degrees of Success the Explorers can score on any Tech-Use Tests, plus an extra minute for each Degree of Failure on this Test. Depending on how they slipped past the patrols, this \ndelay might mean that a patrol of one Wych for each Explorer \npasses the console—with all of the complications and risks that being caught in a restricted area involve, including at the very least a ﬁght, a loss of Favour, or both.\nSPECIALISED  EXPERTISE\nOne of the Explorers has a special skill which Anyalra wants to use, and so she calls the group to her personal chambers because of some specialised knowledge, information, or experience, or a skill, or simply because of a quirk of his physiology or race. This is a chance for the Explorer to gain access to Anyalra and her quarters, though it might also place them in harm’s way if the task is dangerous (such as trying to \ndecipher a Chaos tome or conduct a vivisection of an especially \nornery Genestealer). Because of the specialised nature of this challenge, the Skills and abilities needed to complete it vary based on the Explorer who catches Anyalra’s dark gaze. The Explorer, likely with the aid of his companions, must try to work his own agenda into the task he has been given, completing it to Anyalra’s satisfaction while getting what he needs to escape. All of this needs to done without making Anyalra overly suspicious or annoying her, lest she turn her ire on the Explorer. If the group can fulﬁl Anyalra’s request and complete her task, they gain three Favour, but if they fail or provoke her wrath, they lose two Favour and may even ﬁnd themselves on a direct trip to an especially cruel bout in the arena."

During their preparations, Domos aids them as much as he can. Whether or not the Explorers choose to incite a major uprising, the old Tech-Priest is ready to direct the ire of all of the Withered Blade’s captives toward revenge against the Dark Eldar, and at the very least this may help cover their escape. If the GM feels that the Explorers are hesitant to attempt an escape, even once they have weapons and allies, he can use Salaine, or any of the PCs’ other allies from outside the pits, to try to spur them into action, reminding them of the impending arrival of the renegade ﬂeet. When the Explorers are ready, the GM can begin the escape and the inevitable consequences it brings, which plunge the Nexus into a sea of blood and ﬁre, ending this chapter and transitioning into Chapter III: Maelstrom of Souls. \nAs in Chapter I: The Queen of Shadows, the Explorers \nhave made little in the way of tangible ﬁnancial gains over the course of their tenure in the pit.

Details on the motivations and roles each of these enemies and allies play in the battle for the Nexus, and how the actions of the Explorers can change the battle’s \noutcome, can be found in each section of this chapter.\nEscape!\nHaving bled in the arena and fought for their survival as \nslaves of the Withered Blade, the Explorers have now won the chance to escape their bonds and make their \nbid for freedom. Whether or not they explicitly include their allies in the attempt, Domos also uses their efforts to make his own long-awaited escape, leading to a slave uprising and casting the ﬁrst stone in the battle for the Nexus. The Explorers can be part of the uprising if they choose, and the GM should make them feel like it would surely fail without their assistance if they decide to participate once they have escaped the slave \npens. However, while their chances of success are slim without \nthe Explorers’ assistance, the slaves attempt their uprising with or without their aid so long as they visited the pits. The Explorers’ arrival in the Withered Blade slave pens sparked Domos’ passion for freedom aﬂame once again and motivated him to break free, leading an army of slaves behind him. In either case, the GM should consider the Explorers’ escape as parallel to the uprising, and while the uprising can certainly aid them, they still have to face their own perils and overcome the challenges that their original mission still poses.\nTHE TICKING CLOCK\nThere is no set timeline for Salaine’s attempt to conquer the Nexus, and throughout the adventure the GM can have events progress as quickly or as slowly as he chooses. During the Explorers’ period of slavery, weeks or even months could pass before they have the chance to launch a decent escape attempt. If the GM chooses, he can add an additional level of suspense by placing a time limit on the actions of the Explorers once they escape (or even shortly beforehand). Salaine can contact them, informing them of the imminent arrival of the renegade ﬂeet thanks to the impatience of some of the reckless pirates and raiders under her command. \nThough the Dark Eldar are masters of devious plans that \nrequire inhuman patience, many of the humans and other aliens she has allied with are not willing to wait an eternity for their chance to strike at the Nexus and claim some of its wealth. This news should remind the Explorers that it is vitally important that they disable the Razor’s Web before the ﬂeet arrives. Events in the Nexus of Shadows can also prompt the Explorers’ to act as the uprising boils over into other parts of the city and spreads out of control, inciting a harsh reprisal from the Dark Eldar and making it clear to the Explorers that if they do not act swiftly, the rebellion may founder and be crushed, their new allies—and their chance at a second attempt on The  Soul Reaver—dying along with it.Chapter III: \nMaelstrom \nof Souls\n“There can be no greater power than that over life and death. How complete will be my control when the lives of men are mine to toy with not just while they breathe and walk cloaked in ﬂesh, but when they are no more than whispers in the W arp. The Soul Reaver is that power, and like the Nexus of Shadows it shall bow to my will in the end!”\n–Archon Salaine Morn\nThe third and ﬁnal chapter of the adventure follows the Explorers’ escape from their captivity at the hands of the Cult of the Withered Blade, the slave uprising they help \nincite, and their second attempt to steal The Soul Reaver, and the \nconsequences of the heist. From this point, events begin to move rapidly, and Salaine begins her attack on the Nexus. Whether or not the Razor’s Web is completely disabled, the renegade ﬂeet attacks and Drecarus and the Splintered Talon respond by throwing everything they have at Salaine’s forces. Amidst the chaos, the Explorers play a pivotal role in determining the victor \nand have the opportunity to help numerous minor organisations \nand individuals of the Nexus realise their goals. This is the \ntime to call in any favours they have left, as the Explorers are \nalso hard pressed to survive Drecarus’ wrath. When he ﬁnally realises the extent to which they have contributed to Salaine’s return, he singles them out for special attention and destruction by his warriors. Finally, the PCs have to deal with The  Soul \nReaver  itself, and the ancient vessel becomes as much a peril \nto Drecarus and the Kabal he controls as to any of the other hapless inhabitants of the Nexus.\nDepending on the actions of the Explorers up to this \npoint, there are several different ways in which the battle for the Nexus of Shadows can take place, and a variety of antagonists who can complicate the PCs’ ambitions or help them to realise their victory. By this point, the Explorers may have fallen out with Salaine, their deal gone sour or their suspicions running rampant after their capture and time as “guests” of the Withered Blade. The GM should feel free to \nchange the major players and those who come to the aid of \nthe Explorers during this ﬁnal battle to reﬂect the group’s particular allies and enemies within the Nexus of Shadows. Ultimately, the factions fall into three groups: those that have allied themselves with the Explorers, those that have allied themselves with Drecarus and the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, and those that favour no side, and may change their allegiances even during the ﬁnal conﬂict. Complicating this \nis the unleashed The Soul Reaver, powered by Zaergarn’s \nvengeful spirit, which is beyond such mortal concerns as \nalliance and merely wishes to see the Gaelan Sphere \nand everyone present burn. Even at this late stage \nof the adventure, the Explorers may yet gain \nsupport for their cause from strange places."

      "text": "75\nIII: Maelstrom of Souls\nIII: Maelstrom of Souls\nIII: Maelstrom of Souls\nOUT OF THE PIT\nThe ﬁrst part of any plan for the Explorers to escape \nrequires them to gather in the pits. Whether it is before or after the uprising has begun, they need to make sure each of their number is free and ready to escape. In the course of their normal duties, the Explorers should all be able to get in contact with each other, and have likely been working together to get weapons and allies for their escape. The GM can therefore have them already together when the chapter opens and the great escape begins. Alternatively, the GM might choose to throw in a last-minute complication, forcing \nthe Explorers to re-evaluate their best laid plans in the face \nof new information. The ﬁrst few minutes of the escape are also the most crucial, and when they make their break, the Explorers must overcome several initial obstacles. The GM can use any or all of the encounters below for the PCs to overcome as they gather together and try to establish a force of their allies with which to launch their escape.\nA FITT ING DISTRACTION\nThe Explorers’ chances to escape increase if they can manage to create a distraction to draw the attention of Anyalra and her Dark Eldar guards. If the Explorers do not have a speciﬁc ruse in mind, Domos can suggest manipulating the gravity in one of the ﬁghting pits during a beast display, hurling the monsters into the crowd and causing mayhem. To make this happen, one or more of the Explorers need to access the suspensor ﬁelds, either by tapping into the Gaelan Sphere’s \nsystems from within the restricted areas of the household, \nor by killing the Dark Eldar pit-master and taking over the controls themselves. Once they have reached a console in a forbidden zone (by stealth, deception, or some other clever scheme), turning the governing systems to their own ends requires a Hard (–20) Tech-Use Test, though the assistance \nof an individual with the Forbidden Lore (Archeotech) Skill reduces this Test to a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. \nThe GM can also complicate this by having patrols searching for any Explorers who are attempting to subvert the gravity ﬁelds, forcing them to work rapidly against time. Taking on the Dark Eldar pit-master for control of the pit is even harder, and requires getting past at least one group of eight Wyches and a patrol of eight Kabalite Warriors, as well as penetrating the sealed chamber overseeing the pit. If the Explorers \nsucceed at breaching these defences, however, it only requires \nan Easy (+30) Tech-Use Test to get the result they desire. \nThe carnage the rampaging beasts cause is impressive, but the \ncreatures could well become an obstacle later, as they hardly discriminate between prey, whether or not that speciﬁc prey happened to release them from their captivity.\nWELCOME  TO THE PARTY\nThe Explorers can use the escape attempt to try to eliminate the Dark Eldar associated with the Cult of the Withered Blade, killing or disabling some of the Dark Eldar leadership in a single surprise attack. The most likely place for this to"

If the Explorers can sneak weapons in, they can spring a surprise attack, gaining one or more Rounds of ﬁre on the Dark Eldar before their captors have a chance to take up weapons or call for help. Cunning Explorers could even take advantage of one of the matches the Dark Eldar stage with their gladiators, giving them real weapons which they can then turn upon their masters. They could also try to poison the Dark Eldar’s banquet, or somehow sabotage their torture \ndevices to turn back upon them. The GM should allow the \nExplorers to plan out an ambush using whatever ideas they have, and at very least give them the ﬁrst Round of combat against the Dark Eldar before they react, with a potential to gain more Rounds to attack without reprisal depending on their success. Anyalra, in her cruel practicality, is unlikely to be drawn in by such ambushes, and even if surprised by such a combat, she leaves her guests to die so that she might retreat and muster warriors to her before striking in force.\nNO ONE LEFT BEHIND\nWhile the Explorers can fairly easily gather together before their escape attempt, it might be that one of their new allies, or even a member of the party, is locked away for punishment (for some transgression in the previous chapter, or due to poor luck) and must be freed. This can either be the spark that begins the escape, or be dealt with as part of their breakout. The Explorers can use stealth, guile, force, or some combination of the three to ﬁnd their way down into the \ndeepest cells of the Shadowspine Pits, where they have to \novercome numerous guards to open up the cells and \nﬁnd their friend. The deep cells that hold the most \nimportant or dangerous prisoners are guarded by \nan elite cadre of Hekatrix Bloodbrides equal \nin number to the Explorers (see page 124 for the proﬁle for Hekatrix Bloodbrides). Further, there are no less than three barriers that the Explorers must overcome, either with codes obtained through Favour, a Hard (–20) \nTech-Use Test, or brute force (such as explosives). Obviously, openly breaching the barriers brings down the wrath of the \nCult of the Withered Blade, and the Explorers may ﬁnd their \nrevolution starting ahead of schedule if they are not careful.\nONE FINAL  CONTEST\nAs the Explorers execute their escape plan and Dark Eldar \nmobilise to put down the threat, there are those from the Withered Blade who seek out the chance to join in combat again with the Explorers. The GM can have the route to freedom force the Explorers to pass through the pits, where a group of Wyches (or Hekatrix Bloodbrides if the Explorers are Rank 5 or higher) of the Withered Blade equal in number to the Explorers await to make a stand against them. The GM can set this encounter up as an arena combat using the guidelines from Table 2–6: Arena Hazards on \npage 66. The GM should have the Dark Eldar change the \nﬁghting conditions to suit their needs from Round to Round, \nproviding themselves with lower gravity for greater mobility or dumping scrap into the pit to provide cover. As long as the Dark Eldar control the pit, traps and random effects (like Dragon’s Breath) only affect the Explorers and their allies.\nGM G UIDANCE : SETTLING  SCORES\nThough the Explorers face Anyalra and overcome her on their way out of the pits, they are not required to hunt down every individual who has wronged them. That said, the GM should consider allowing them opportunities to wreak their vengeance upon any \nparticularly hated individuals during the chaos of \nthe uprising. These NPCs either join the rest of the Withered Blade in defending the Sphere or ﬂee for their lives. In the case of those slaves who sided willingly with the Dark Eldar, now that the tables have turned, they might plead to join the uprising. The GM can also use the PCs’ desire for vengeance to complicate matters, as it may well be difﬁcult or dangerous to hunt down one of their hated enemies. If the Explorers go after minor NPCs, then the challenges are less intimidating, and the GM might want to give them the opportunity to take them on without jeopardising their escape plans. More important NPCs mean larger problems, though, and the Explorers may have to make difﬁcult decisions when choosing between revenge and liberty."

      "text": "77\nIII: Maelstrom of Souls\nIII: Maelstrom of Souls\nIII: Maelstrom of Souls\nBRINGING  DOWN  THE BARRIERS\nThe ﬁnal barrier the Explorers need to breach is the set of \ncontainment ﬁelds and blast doors sealing the Shadowspine Pits off from the Shadow Arteries. By the time the Explorers reach this point, the Dark Eldar are fully aware of the extent of their escape attempt and have rallied to try to stop them. This is also where the PCs face Anyalra and any of the enemies they might have made during their time in slavery. This combat takes place across several tunnels and large chambers, with plenty of cover and places to hide or gain good vantage from. The Explorers must reach one of the main blast doors \nand either disable or destroy this ﬁnal obstacle to complete \ntheir escape. The Dark Eldar should be well prepared in their \ndefence, requiring the Explorers to ﬁght their way up towards the central portal against Wyches, Kabalite Warriors, Hellions, and Beast Masters and their foul pets, such as Khymerae. \nDomos and the escaped slaves are there to help, and the GM \ncan run the encounter as a massed combat, (if he wishes to use the rules described in B\nATTLEFLEET  KORONUS ), where the \nleadership of the Explorers is as important as their ﬁghting skills. Otherwise, he can treat it as a challenge in which the Explorers must succeed at a number of Challenging (+0) \nCommand Tests to resolve various crises as they occur (such as groups of Bloodbrides striking at a weak ﬂank in their lines, or attempting to ﬂood the complex with a paralytic agent that will incapacitate the rebelling captives). If the Explorers succeed at their Command Test, their followers bring the situation under control; if they fail, their allies \ncannot deal with the problem, and the Explorers themselves \nmust intervene to save the day. There are countless problems \nthat might require their personal attention in this way, but \ngroups of elite soldiers like Hekatrix Bloodbrides or Reaver Pilots with jetbikes equal to the number of Explorers, doors that have been soldered shut, and hallways ﬁlled with deadly traps (drawn from Table 2–6: Arena Hazards on page 66) \nall provide an appropriate challenge (see page 123-124 for the proﬁles for these NPCs). The GM should reward clever tactics in this section, such as the PCs manipulating the Gaelan Sphere’s systems to activate defences against the Dark Eldar, using stealth to sneak past the outer defenders, or creating a stampede of arena beasts to clear the way ahead of them. \nOn the other side of the blast doors waits Anyalra, \naccompanied by a cadre of her most elite Hekatrix Bloodbrides in a group equal to the number of Explorers plus three. She has anticipated the Explorers’ move and intends to ﬁnish the rebellion herself with a single decapitating blow. During \nthis encounter, the Explorers must face her head-on; their \nreinforcements will be tied down by the other guards, and champions such as themselves are needed to break through an elite force like the one blocking their path. NPC allies should generally be occupied performing critical tasks elsewhere at this point (such as holding the ﬂank, directing the efforts of the liberated army, or ﬁghting another champion who threatens to overwhelm them from behind) so that the Explorers \ncan achieve this victory on their own. This also means that \nthe Explorers have control over the way that the ﬁght ends, \nprovided of course that they win; they can try to kill Anyalra, \nforce her to retreat, or even offer her a deal if they spare her life. This battle allows for a clear end to the Explorers’ time \nas slaves of the arena, and gives them a much-needed chance \nto repay the Succubus for her “hospitality.” Anyalra’s proﬁle can be found in Chapter IV: The Treacherous Path on page 121, and the Hekatrix Bloodbride proﬁle can be found on page 124. Read aloud the following when the Explorers breach the blast doors and step outside:\nBefore you stands Anyalra, ﬂanked by several of her elite Hekatrix Bloodbrides. “I admit, I was angry at ﬁrst that you wretches had dared to waste my time with yet another tedious uprising. But indulging too long in raw anger is kind of waste as well, and you have performed much better than I expected. Revel \nin your small victory, for you have now provided me with an end \nto my boredom, however brief it may be. And for your efforts, I \nwill grant you the highest reward I ever offer a slave: I will sully \nmy hands with your blood when I tear out your hearts myself.”\nAnyalra attempts to engage the Explorers in melee combat \none at a time, using her Bloodbrides to separate the Explorers \nand prevent those who might interfere with her duels from getting too close. Although Anyalra usually prefers not to take great risks, now that the Explorers have engaged her in personal combat, she feels the joy of bloodshed close at hand and seeks the thrill of the ﬁght. She ﬁrst targets the PC who she considers to be the most worthy melee opponent (the one who made the most impressive melee kill or kills in the pits). She focuses exclusively on her chosen target until she has either incapacitated or slain that foe, before moving on to the next most potent ﬁghter. Her Bloodbrides work in concert to provide her the opportunities to ﬁght these one-on-one battles, harassing and separating the Explorers, and all focusing on different targets unless there is no other \noption. Anyalra accepts a request for her to surrender if she \nloses to a PC opponent in hand-to-hand combat, and her Bloodbrides stand down as well, allowing the army to pass, though she ﬁghts to the bitter end if she does not believe that the Explorers will (or even can, given the angry army of former slaves) spare her life.\nOnce the Explorers are united, with their allies in tow \nand Domos spurring them on towards a full-blown uprising, they can try to escape the Shadowspine Pits. At this point the escape and uprising are contained to the Withered Blade, and Drecarus and the Splintered Talon do not play a part, nor do the other factions of the Nexus of Shadows. As the Explorers \nenter the city proper, Salaine also makes her move, \nsummoning her renegade ﬂeet and plunging \nthe city into open warfare as the Dark \nEldar attack each other in the \nskies above and on the \nstreets below."

The slave army can consist of pretty much any human or xenos slaves the GM chooses, risen up from the countless houses and pits controlled by the Dark Eldar as their fellow slaves free them. There are many, many \nmore slaves in the Nexus than there are Dark Eldar or free \nmen (or free xenos), and though they are under-equipped, \nthey are highly motivated and, with the guidance of Domos and other leaders, able and willing to ﬁght to the bitter end.\nFor the GM, the slave army represents a way to plunge \nthe Nexus of Shadows into chaos, having mobs of freed slaves running rampant in the tunnels and towers of the city, attacking Dark Eldar and tearing down the aliens’ defences. In combination with the attack by Salaine and the renegade ﬂeet, it adds to the general carnage and sense that the Nexus is ﬁghting for its life. Slaves can be used to help the Explorers by distracting the Dark Eldar or covering their attack on The Soul Reaver, and make a useful tool which the PCs can, \nif they so choose, exploit. The slave army also presents the PCs with a choice that raises moral and practical questions, about whether or not they help the slaves in their bid for freedom, or simply focus on their own goals.\nDARK ELDAR RESPONSE\nThe Dark Eldar are swift and ruthless in putting down the slave uprising, having no qualms about wiping out any slaves who turn against them. In fact, the uprising leads to a purge targeting all slaves in the Nexus of Shadows, which in turn fuels the revolting slaves’ will to keep ﬁghting and inspires more slaves to join the ﬁght for freedom, as they realise they have nothing to lose by doing so. At ﬁrst, Dark Eldar patrols \ntry to contain the slaves, putting down isolated groups as they \nﬁnd them, though once it becomes clear to the Dark Eldar that their normal enforcers are not sufﬁcient against hundreds of rioting slaves, they begin to mobilise for a full-scale battle. This occurs an hour or two after the Explorers have escaped the Shadowspine Pits, giving the slaves a chance to spread out into the surrounding zones before the Dark Eldar realise the extent of the danger and gather their forces. From this point on, things quickly escalate as Domos organises the slaves and accrues more heavy weapons and vehicles, and those choosing to ally with the slaves throw their lot in with the Tech-Priest.\nThe GM should have these events play out in the \nbackground depending on the actions of the Explorers. The PCs are aware at ﬁrst only of the ﬁghting around the Shadowspine Pits. Then more and more Dark Eldar arrive to crush the uprising, until eventually Raider transports and heavy weapon squads arrive on the scene. This has a distinct effect on the rest of the city; the garrisons of the Splintered \nTalon begin to converge on the uprising as Kabalite Warriors \nare drawn away from their posts to help put it down. Over the Uprising\nParallel to the Explorers’ own escape attempt is the slave uprising, and the aspiration to escape the Nexus of Shadows that many of the NPCs hold. Depending on \nthe actions of the Explorers, the GM can have the PCs central to the uprising, even pivotal to its success if they are focused on freeing as many slaves as possible and stirring them to action with rousing speeches and promises of vengeance. However, regardless of their involvement, the uprising begins when the Explorers begin their escape, and continues to escalate while they try for a second time to steal The Soul \nReaver . Inspired by the Explorers, Domos and his web of allies \nin the Shadowspine Pits make their bid for freedom.\nTHE SLAVE ARMY\nThroughout this chapter, there is a steadily rising tide of slaves tearing the Nexus apart, growing in number as Domos and the slave gladiators break into new sections of the city and liberate those enslaved there. The Explorers can involve themselves as heavily as they wish in the uprising, or they \ncan focus completely on their own goals. At least in its ﬁrst \nstages, help from the Explorers allows the uprising to escalate \nfaster, spreading more disorder and giving the PCs a better \nchance at stealing The Soul Reaver. Once in full swing, it rages \nout of control until it is eventually put down, or until the Explorers make a real effort to restrain it so that the Nexus \n78\n78\n78\n78"

Getting from the pits to The Soul Reaver can be broken down into three parts: their \nﬂight from the Shadowspine Pits into the Nexus of Shadows, their journey across the city avoiding or confronting the Dark Eldar defenders, and ﬁnally their assault on Zaergarn’s ziggurat and their ﬁght to reach The Soul Reaver. To successfully stealing \nthe vessel, they also need to have their vessel on standby to anchor onto The  Soul Reaver and tear it free of its moorings. \nThis means taking it back and moving it into position beyond \nthe reach of the Razor’s Web before making their run. Once \nthey are free of the Shadowspine Pits, Salaine gets in contact with them again, and depending on their feelings towards her \n(whether or not they think she has betrayed them and resent her \nfor it), she may join with them again. If Salaine’s promises and \nurging is not enough to prompt the PCs to try for The Soul Reaver  \nagain then Domos also tries to convince them of its importance. \nThe Explorers should be aware that everything still hinges on removing The Soul Reaver from the ziggurat and ejecting it from \nthe webway, thereby cutting off the Razor’s Web from its power source and opening up the skies over the Nexus for either the renegade ﬂeet or the slaves to conquer the city.\nAt this stage the Explorers should decide just how they are \ngoing to remove The Soul Reaver, as they can do so either by \nstealth or by force, though with the slaves rising up against the Dark Eldar, there is likely to be a bit of both involved. The Explorers also need to ﬁgure out how to contact their vessel to have it ready to tear out The Soul Reaver. Their best options \nare to ﬂy it through the Razor’s Web to The Soul Reaver, or \nto ﬁnd a way to hail it before inﬁltrating on foot to The Soul \nReaver  and disabling the Razor’s Web so their ship can move \nin safely. In either instance, their ﬂight from the Shadowspine Pits and journey across the city remains the same, as whether they are aiming for the ziggurat or their vessel, they must ﬁrst get past the growing number of Dark Eldar opposing them.\nFLIGHT FROM THE \nSHADOWS PINE PITS\nStriding over the broken bodies of Withered Blade Wyches, \nthe slaves stream out of the Shadowspine Pits and into the Shadow Arteries. The Explorers are carried along with them in a raging tide. Two things should be apparent to the PCs at this stage (spelled out by either Domos as he musters his forces, or Salaine as she re-establishes contact): the uprising \nGM G UIDANCE : H EROES  NO M ORE\nAt this point, the Explorers may choose to leave the slaves to their fate, in which case the GM can proceed to An Overlooking View  on page 82. Doing so \nmeans that the rebellion is doomed, but the Explorers did not come to the Nexus of Shadows as liberators and they are not obligated to help others. As such, at this point they receive a message from Salaine Morn \n(by communications device if they possess one, or by \nScourge messenger if they do not) urging them to meet her atop a tower near their location. If they do wish to assist in the uprising, they may take part in any or all of the following encounters, about which Magos Domos (or any other prominent NPC involved in the uprising) informs them. Though the uprising may be peripheral to their interests at this point, it does provide an excellent distraction, and without it the Splintered Talon can focus all of its forces on ﬁghting the war against Salaine’s alliance—which includes the Explorers."

The GM should allow the Explorers to formulate their own plans to \nreach their vessel and The Soul Reaver, reminding them that \ntime is of the essence and that travelling on foot through the \nvast distances of the Sphere’s tunnels is not fast enough. Once they have come up with some kind of plan, the GM can play through the encounters below, modifying them depending \non the tactics taken by the Explorers.\nBLEEDING  ARTERIES\nAs the slaves enter the city proper, pandemonium breaks out \namongst the populace, and the Dark Eldar’s initial response is to shoot everything that moves. Unless the Explorers want to slink away into the shadows, they can help the slave army to claim a part of the Shadow Arteries as a staging ground by neutralising the Dark Eldar present and securing its entrances and exits. Unfortunately, a squad of Scourges (one for each Explorer, and one additional Scourge for each Explorer Rank 5 or higher) with heavy weapons holds a series of positions overlooking this area, and the Explorers must eliminate them before the slave army can effectively advance without being torn apart by their withering ﬁre. The Explorers must spot, \ntrack, or predict the position of each individual Scourge \neven as they rain death down upon the advancing force, and \nlocate each one with a Hard (–20) Awareness Test or a \nChallenging (+0) Tracking or Scholastic Lore (Tactica \nImperialis) Test. Once the Explorers ﬁnd a Scourge, they \nalso determine a way to slay or drive off the winged menace. See page 126 for the Scourge proﬁle.\nA C HANCE  AT GLORY\nOnce the staging ground has been established, the Explorers can help by sealing off avenues of counterattack by the Splintered Talon. There are ﬁve portals through which the primary Dark Eldar reinforcements are coming, and these need to be sealed so that the slave army can gather for a push on the Bone Spires. Each one is guarded by a Kabalite Trueborn and a contingent of Kabalite Warriors equal in number to the Explorers, plus one extra Kabalite Trueborn for each Explorer Rank 5 or higher (see pages 122-123 for these proﬁles). Every three Rounds, two Kabalite Warriors (or two Kabalite Trueborn if any Explorer is Rank 5 or higher) arrive in the \njunction from each portal. Once the Explorers have sealed a \nportal by making a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test, by \ndestroying the tunnel with a Ordinary (+10) Demolitions \nTest and the appropriate equipment, or by some other ingenuity on their part, reinforcements from that portal cease to arrive. Once all ﬁve portals have been sealed, the Explorers must only contend with the remaining Dark Eldar. \nWA R OF VENGEANCE\nThe slaves tear the city apart and engage in open war with the Dark Eldar throughout the battle. Before, during, or after the Explorers deal with Zaergarn and The Soul Reaver, they can inﬂuence the outcome of this conﬂict. If they make their presence known in the city, Domos makes one or more pleas for their aid to swing the battle in the favour of the slaves. The GM can use any or all of the following encounters to represent the uprising and the Explorers’ chances to alter its outcome. If the Explorers fail to attempt and complete at least one of the following encounters, the uprising founders and is quashed. If the Explorers complete all of the following encounters successfully, the slaves gain full control of the Nexus of Shadows (see pages 93-94 for the consequences of this development).\nCRACKING  OPEN THE ARMOURY\nDomos and the slaves need to get heavy weapons if they are to challenge the Dark Eldar for the Nexus of Shadows. Throughout the Archon’s palace and around the base of the ziggurat, there are garrisons and armouries that the Splintered Talon uses to equip its Kabalite Warriors. There are also other caches of weapons held by various aliens, either arms traders or paranoid xenos who distrust the Dark Eldar’s hospitality. The Explorers can help the slaves break into one of these armouries and plunder its goods. The armouries are always heavily defended and shielded, and require both stealth and brute force to breach. The Explorers must provide the stealth while the slave army provides the \nbrute force. Each armoury is a veritable fortress, but has some \nsort of vulnerability that the Explorers can exploit to open \nthe defences from within. To break into a Splintered Talon \nweapons depot, the Explorers must ascertain the armoury’s \nparticular weakness by making a successful Challenging \n(+0) Tech-Use Test while at a console attached to the sphere’s governing systems. Then, they must slip past or quietly slay a patrol of Kabalite Trueborn equal in number to their group or twice the number of their party if any Explorer is Rank 5 or higher (see page 123 for the Kabalite Trueborn proﬁle). Becoming embroiled in a prolonged ﬁre-ﬁght (more than 5 Rounds) against the ﬁrst group of sentries alerts a second patrol of Kabalite Trueborn equal in number to the ﬁrst. After overcoming these challenges, it is a simple task to disable the defences and let the slaves into the armoury. Each Explorer may also select a single Dark Eldar armament with \nan availability up to Rare to take for himself.\nINSPIRED  LEADERSHIP\nEven though the slaves are hungry for vengeance, they are \ngenerally poorly led and poorly trained, the majority taken from remote worlds along the edges of the Calixis Sector. The Explorers can help them by giving them suitable leadership and inspiration. The Explorers must score a combined 5 Degrees of Success on any number of Challenging (+0) \nCommand or Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) \nTests, modiﬁed by bonuses from Talents, equipment, and knowledge as appropriate (however, each Explorer may only make each kind of Test once during this challenge). If the \nExplorers score more than three Degrees of Failure on any \ntwo of these Tests before accumulating the required Degrees of Success, however, order breaks down and the Explorers have wasted their efforts."

Navigating the sub-levels is dangerous work, and successfully reaching each of the three ducts that must be opened requires a Challenging \n(+0) Navigation (Surface) or guidance by a local of the \nNexus of Shadows. On the way to each vent, the Explorers \nare also put at risk by the perils that await in the lower \ndepths. For each Degree of Failure on a given Navigation  Test, the Explorers run across one encounter from Table \n0–1: Nexus of Shadows Encounters (see page 21). If the \nExplorers open all three vents, they destroy several of the \nstrongest towers within the Bonespires and greatly increase the slaves’ chances of claiming the Nexus.\nAN OVERLOOKING  VIEW\nFor the Explorers, climbing a tower also means the chance to get some faster transportation or hail their ship. This is an opportunity for the Explorers to settle any grudges against Dark Eldar nobles such as Ravyr Dysk that they may have accumulated over the course of the adventure. It is also the \ntime of their reunion with Salaine Morn, who is waiting \nfor the Explorers at the top of the tower. Once they have dispatched any residents of the tower (or if the residents have already ﬂed) and reached the top of the spire, read or paraphrase the following aloud:\nSalaine Morn stands before you, ﬂanked by a cadre of her warriors and overlooking the Nexus of Shadows as the ﬁres of revolution begin to spread.

Your little escape plan should \nnever have worked, and yet here you stand.... Just as I predicted.” She motions curtly to the transports she has prepared for you. “Of course, you could always return to your ship and leave—if you can slip past the Razor’s W eb. But you’ll stay. For the treasure, but for that stubborn pride, too. The plan moves forward inevitably, and we draw closer to the end. Take The Soul Reaver and it is over. \nTake The Soul Reaver, and we win.”\nSalaine Morn is accompanied by eight Kabalite Warriors, \nplus another eight hiding in the shadows of the tower in case the Explorers decide to vent their frustrations on her (the proﬁle for Salaine Morn can be found on page 119, and the proﬁle for Kabalite Warriors can be found on page 122). Assuming that \nthey do not choose this as the time and place to make a stand \nagainst Salaine, however, the Explorers depart on the transport (one or two per Reaver jetbike or up to six per Venom) and Salaine slips back to her place with the ﬂeet to prepare it for the initial assault, bombarding the Nexus from beyond the \neffective range of the Razor’s Web to soften the Splintered \nTalon’s forces as much as possible before the ﬁnal push.THE BEASTS  OF W AR\nDuring the ﬁghting, scores of beasts escape from the arena, most of which are now rampaging around attacking indiscriminately. As the Dark Eldar retreat to their towers, the beasts become more and more of a problem for the slaves. Each beast (or group of beasts) must be tracked down with an Ordinary (+10) Tracking Test and slain. The beasts \nrunning rampant are as follows: one ﬂock of Razorwings (with two Razorwings for each Explorer), one Clawed Fiend, one pack of Khymerae (with one Khymera for each Explorer), and one Fleshwrought Drake (see page 133 for \nthe proﬁle for these beasts). The Explorers must eliminate \nthese creatures within two hours of narrative time (or one \nhour if the Explorers are of Rank 5 or higher), before they too badly deplete the forces of the rebellion.\nTOPPLING  THE TOWERS\nBefore the slaves can defeat the Dark Eldar in the city, they need to capture the Bonespires, the centre for the Splintered Talon’s resistance outside of the ziggurat. Some of the towers \ncan be taken by force, though others \nare nigh impossible for the slaves \nto breach as they are protected by \npotent shadow ﬁelds and other \nalien tech. Domos comes upon \nthe idea that a large cluster \nof these towers can \nbe destroyed by \nventing gases \nand waste from the \nfusion core through \ntheir foundations, \nmelting away their \nsupport and bringing \nthem down. While the \nMagos must remain in \nthe city to direct the \nuprising, he asks the \nExplorers to delve \ndown into the core \nof the sphere to \nset this plan \nin motion. \nThis is the \ndeepest the \nExplorers \naccumulated over the course of the adventure. It is also the \ntime of their reunion with Salaine Morn, who is waiting \nfor the Explorers at the top of the tower.

This is a dangerous prospect, as the skies have been locked down by the Dark Eldar, who are shooting down everyone who is not a member \nof the Splintered Talon or under Drecarus’ direct control. \nThere is also the added danger that the Razor’s Web is fully \nactive, and though it cannot target ships ﬂying low among \nthe towers of the city, it creates a deadly ceiling that all non-Dark Eldar airborne craft cannot cross. By this point, unless \nthe Explorers have focused on keeping a low proﬁle in the \nrebellion, Drecarus has identiﬁed them as a real danger to the Splintered Talon and dispatched hunters to bring them down. The GM can use the encounters below to map the Explorers’ ﬁght across the city and determine how close they can get to their destinations before they are forced down or resistance becomes too ﬁerce to continue.\nUNDER  THE RAZOR\nTo cross the city, the Explorers need to stay below the effective targeting ﬁeld of the Razor’s Web, weaving among the towers and hugging the surface of the sphere. The Razor’s Web cannot target personal craft, but with Salaine’s ﬂeet in a high orbit just outside of its optimal range, many of the guns have begun to sound, and their discharge can easily vaporise anything unfortunate enough to be near the muzzle \nof one of the great macrocannons. Any time a vessel passes \ninto the airspace covered by the Razor’s Web, its pilot must \nmake a Hard (–20) Pilot (Flyers) Test or the craft suffers \n4d10 Energy Damage as gargantuan weapons discharge \naround it. Flying at low altitude has its risks as well, however, as it means that there is always a danger of collision, and unless the pilot is focusing solely on ﬂying the craft, he must make a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Flyers) Test each Round \nin addition to any other actions he takes. Failing this Test means he must quickly correct his course to avoid harm which requires the rest of his Turn, while failing by four or more Degrees of Failure means he has clipped an obstacle and his craft suffers 2d10+5 Impact Damage, and on the following Round he must pass another Challenging (+0) \nPilot (Flyers) Test as his sole action or crash.\nHUNTERS  HUNTED\nAs soon as the Explorers leave the tower and head for the ziggurat, a group of Reaver Pilots on jetbikes and Hellion Gangers on skyboards targets the group (see pages 123 and 125 for the proﬁles for these foes). Seeing the carnage in the streets, these sadistic killers have decided to join in the fun, striking at anything that catches their attention. The Explorers are attacked by a group of two Hellions Gangers on skyboards per Explorer or one Reaver Pilot on a jetbike per Explorer \n(or one group of each if any Explorer is Rank 5 or higher). \nThe GM can play this out as part combat, part chase, with a few furious Rounds of combat before the terrain separates the combatants and the Explorers must use their piloting skills to outdistance their pursuers. The GM should reward clever tactics by the Explorers during this encounter, such as using trying to ram the enemy jetbikes into obstacles, attempting to \nlose them through fancy ﬂying, swooping down into the crust \nof the sphere through tight tunnels and churning machinery, or \neven tricking their pursuers into ﬂying into one another.\nTARGETS  OF OPPORTUNITY\nWhile the Explorers are crossing the city, they might also have the chance to help out the uprising by hitting some targets of opportunity. These consist of Raiders and other vehicles carrying Kabalite Warriors from the ziggurat to the Shadow Arteries. The GM can blend these targets into the chase across the city, possibly having Domos prompting the PCs from afar for help if they come near an area of the ﬁghting. These should \nonly be brief encounters, each a Round or two in length, as \nthe PCs scream past, unleashing dark lance or splinter cannon ﬁre, and suffering a Round or two of return ﬁre. The GM should keep track of these attacks, and they can add to the overall success of the slaves’ uprising, and can improve the aid that Domos might be willing to offer later. Alternatively, they can become full-blown engagements if the Explorers choose, as they abandon their journey to the ziggurat for a moment to give a group of slaves close air support. Each Raider carries 10 Kabalite Warriors (or 10 Kabalite Trueborn if the Explorers are of Rank 5 or higher). See page 139 for the proﬁle for a Raider and pages 122-123 for the proﬁles for Kabalite Warriors and Kabalite Trueborn."

These are no small tasks, but the Explorers have a golden opportunity to accomplish them with the chaos raging in the city. Though the ziggurat’s defenders are on high alert, they are scattered, still reeling from the blow the uprising has dealt. Even as the Explorers arrive, the Kabal of the Splintered Talon is in the midst of \nmobilising to put down the rebellion in the city. \nSMASH AND GRAB\nThere are still a number of ways in and out of the ziggurat \n(such as those used by the Explorers in the ﬁrst chapter), though resistance is more organised and Drecarus is personally waiting for the PCs. The GM can use the encounters below to play out the Explorers’ assault on the ziggurat, depending on the path they choose and the tactics they use. At the very least, \nthey should be forced to ﬁght their way through Drecarus and \nhis minions, so that they can redress their grievances with the scheming Haemonculus who engineered their ﬁrst defeat.\nSECRET  IN THE GARDEN\nProvided the Explorers do not get shot down crossing the city and have to proceed on foot, the easiest and quickest way into the ziggurat is through the Deathworld Gardens at the top of its central spire. Abandoned by the guards as they respond to the uprising, the Explorers ﬁnd the gardens deserted, though \nno less deadly. If they did not use this route the ﬁrst time, \nand were unaware of its existence, Salaine might offer \nit as an option to break into the palace. The GM can \nuse the guidelines found on page 43 of Chapter \nI: The Queen of Shadows to play out the \nExplorers navigating the gardens and ﬁnding their way down into The Soul Reaver chamber. If the \nExplorers passed through the Deathworld Gardens during their ﬁrst, ill-fated trip to The Soul Reaver, the GM should \nadd additional elements like Dark Eldar pursuers landing just after them and following them in. Having visited the gardens before, however, the Explorers now have the edge in the deadly maze. They should receive a +10 bonus to any Tests to navigate or survive the hazards of the Deathworld Gardens, and should be able to use their past experience to take advantage of the terrain to overcome their pursuers.\nBREAKING  THE SEALS\nAware of their attack and having surmised their objective, Drecarus has sealed the central chamber containing The \nSoul Reaver against all intrusion. To break these seals, the Explorers either need to subvert the sphere’s machine-spirit and override the locks, or blast them open using explosives stolen from the armoury lower down in the ziggurat. Both options require the PCs to travel down deeper into the ziggurat, either seeking out ordnance or looking for a link to the sphere’s ancient core cogitator, either of which requires an Arduous (–40) Navigation (Surface) Test to ﬁnd. \nEach time the Explorers fail this Test, they stumble upon a \ngroup of foes from Table 1–1: Splintered Talon Forces, \non page 46 in Chapter I: The Queen of Shadows. They \nmust then repeat the Navigation Test, but gain a cumulative \n+10 bonus to the Test each time they fail. \nOnce they ﬁnd the chamber, the Explorers must pass \na Hard (–20) Tech-Use Test to disable the doors, or a \nseries of three Routine (+20) Demolition Tests to use \ntheir ordinance to blast through the doors. Each time the Explorers fail one of these Tests, they must ﬁght off a group of guards from Table 1–1: Splintered Talon Forces  \nbefore they can attempt it again.\nGM G UIDANCE : G ETTING  A BIGGER  BOAT\nFor the next stage of their plan, the Explorers will need their ship to tear the Soul Reaver  free. During their stay in the pits, \nthe Explorers’ vessel remains at the Nexus of Shadows, forced to stay in a low orbit just beyond the limits of the city, but prevented from leaving by the trained guns of the Razor’s Web. This means that the Explorers need to contact their vessel and bring it down to assist them—without getting it torn apart by the Razor’s Web. To achieve this, they have two options:\nFirst, the Explorers can attempt to reach their ship and pilot it down through the defences, hoping to get it through \namongst the confusion of the attacking ﬂeet and the rebelling slaves, or anything else the Explorers can unleash upon the Nexus of Shadows. To do this, they need to secure transport up to their ship before invading the ziggurat (they might steal a small Dark Eldar craft, or call upon allies such as Salaine Morne for assistance). Once aboard their vessel, they must make it through the Razor’s Web (See The Razor’s Web on page 39).\nAs another option that requires less risk to their vessel but more risk to themselves, the Explorers could attempt to \nraise their ship remotely, telling it to join them at the Archon’s palace once they have sundered the Soul Reaver  from its \nmooring with their charges, as soon as they have disrupted the Razor’s Web. However, this means that they give up the opportunity to return to their ship to resupply before the ﬁnal battle, and more worryingly, means that they may have to hold the line on their own for some time against the Kabal of the Splintered Talon’s forces before their ship arrives."

During their journey through the palace, the Explorers spot the Haemonculus ﬂeeing into an darkened chamber. Drecarus is a canny foe, and seeks to draw the Explorers deeper and deeper into his twisted lair before engaging them. Drecarus’ experimentation chambers are arranged in a pattern that only the Haemonculus’ deranged \ngenius can fully comprehend, connecting in counter-intuitive \nor nonsensical ways as he sees ﬁt. Thanks to the extraordinary \ntechnology of the Dark Eldar, some doors seem to lead only into darkness, while others vanish as soon as the Explorers cross the threshold. Each chamber the Explorers enter while \nchasing the Haemonculus has a wave of enemies from Table \n1–1: Splintered Talon Forces (see page 46) or some other \nhorrid creature of the GM’s choice and one peril from Table 2–6: Arena Hazards (see page 66). Each time the Explorers wish to choose a new doorway, they must make an Opposed Intelligence Test against Drecarus himself to ﬁnd the method to his madness. Once the Explorers succeed on three of these Tests, they reach the chamber Drecarus has chosen. \nDrecarus awaits with one Wrack for each Explorer and \na Fleshwrought Drake (plus one Grotesque for every two Explorers if any Explorer is Rank 5 or higher). When Drecarus is ﬁrst wounded, the Haemonculus falls back yet again, taunting the Explorers as he goes and leaving his minions to \nkeep them occupied. If he is able to escape, Drecarus seals the \nchamber and ﬂoods it with a deadly toxin before making his \nway to his voidship to deal with Salaine and her ﬂeet. This \nairborne poison is a paralytic neurotoxin; each Explorer who inhales it during a given Round must make a Difﬁcult (–10) \nToughness Test or suffer 1d10 Agility Damage. For every 10 such Agility Damage a character suffers, he loses the use of one randomly selected arm or leg for 1d5 minutes. Once away from the toxin, this Damage heals at the normal rate for Characteristic Damage (see page 251 of the R\nOGUE TRADEr \nCore Rulebook). Opening any of the doors requires a Hard (–20) Tech-Use Test, or an appropriate show of force, such as a Hellish (–60) Strength Test or a Challenging (+0) \nDemolitions Test with proper supplies (perhaps scavenged from the lab itself ). If the Explorers prevent Drecarus from escaping by slaying him (or other means), he still springs the trap, his ﬁnal spiteful cackles echoing in the poisoned air.\nSOUL TEARING\nOnce the Explorers reach The  Soul Reaver, they are faced with \nthe problem of breaking The Soul Reaver free. The charges \nthat they planted in Chapter I: The Queen of Shadows are still in place, but they have been dismantled and the Explorers must make an Ordinary (+10) Demolition \nTest to repair their remote detonators—it takes 5 minutes to reset each charge, minus 1 minute for each Degree of Success on the Test, but if they fail the Test, the Explorers trip an alarm that alerts a patrol of Kabalite Trueborn equal in number to the party (see page 123 for the proﬁle for Kabalite Trueborn). Further, each charge is guarded by one \nWrack and a Grotesque (or two Grotesques if the Explorers \nare of Rank 5 or higher). See pages 126-127 for the proﬁles for Wracks and Grotesques. When the Explorers arrive in \nthe great gantry-ﬁlled chamber surrounding The Soul Reaver  \nto reset the charges (or otherwise ﬁnd a way of breaking the \nvessel free), the read or paraphrase the following aloud:\nOnce again the great curved hull of The Soul Reaver rises before you, its faded bone hull pitted and scarred by years in the void and the slow decay of time. It stands held in the gantries and supports of the ziggurat, immobile and wrapped in metal bonds, bonds which must be broken if it is to be freed. Even as you approach, you can see the W arp energies pulsing around it, arcing out to strike the walls, and ﬂashing and fading from its crystalline edges. It certainly seems more volatile than when you last laid eyes upon it, as if it is drinking deep of the deaths unfolding in the city below and somehow growing in strength…\nHOLD THE LINE!\nOnce the charges have been detonated, the Razor’s Web falls silent and the Explorers’ vessel can move in. Unfortunately, the destruction of the supports alerts the Splintered Talon’s forces to the presence of the Explorers, and the full might of the Kabal descends upon them once again. After the Explorers’ vessel moves into position and ﬁres its grappling cables onto The Soul Reaver, the PCs need to take a position from which \nthey can keep the lines attached. The GM should draw this encounter out over 10+1d5 Rounds, plus an additional"

A new wave of enemies from Table 1–1: Splintered Talon Forces (see Chapter I: The \nQueen of Shadows, page 46) appears every third Round, starting with the ﬁrst. The purpose of this battle is not for the Explorers to defeat all their enemies (a staggering task, given the size of the Splintered Talon’s forces), but to survive until the grapnels are completely set and then get aboard a lander from their ship to escape. If Drecarus is still alive, he should also appear at this battle accompanying the second \nwave of enemies (see page 120 for Drecarus’ proﬁle). During \nthis time, the GM can throw any or all of the complications detailed below at the Explorers in addition to successive waves of Dark Eldar enemies:\nBETRAYAL\nThe battle for The Soul Reaver is also a good place for any \ntreacherous NPCs to turn on the Explorers, or at the very least to try to leave them behind once they make their escape. This can involve any of the NPCs from the arena or the city who the Explorers have wronged, but who have decided to work with the PCs until they ﬁnd an opportunity for revenge. If Henaris Tinis, the leader of the Cult of the \nFalse Dawn, is aiding the Explorers, he and his cultists turn \non the Explorers as they board the lander, trying to force it to leave prematurely, stranding the Explorers in the ziggurat or forcing them to board The Soul Reaver and be dragged \nalong. If there are no Explorers on board their landing craft and Tinis manages to intercept it, he uses brute force or his powers of persuasion to take control of the bridge of the Explorers’ vessel. He then drags The Soul Reaver out of the \nNexus and heads for the Screaming Vortex. Needless to say, Zaergarn still triggers the Maelstrom of Souls, and the Explorers might ﬁnd Tinis suddenly begging for their aid once again as he too tries to dispose of the dead Archon. The Consorvana Ring, or any other group that covets The Soul \nReaver  for itself, might also commit similar treachery.\nRISING  STORM\nThroughout the battle for The Soul Reaver, the alien vessel draws \nin more and more power from the hundreds of deaths occurring in the city and the ziggurat. Those with the Psyniscience Skill can see souls torn from the bodies of the dead to be consumed by the vessel. This creates an area of highly unstable energy, as the veil between reality and the warp becomes thin to the point of breaking. All those ﬁghting within sight of The Soul \nReaver  suffer a –10 penalty to any Willpower Characteristic \nand Skill Tests as the psychic energy saps their will and chills their souls. Psykers may only use their powers at the Push Psychic Strength. In addition, at the beginning of each Round, \nthe GM rolls on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena (see page \n160 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook) and applies the \nresult to the entire chamber surrounding The  Soul Reaver. \nWhere the table indicates the psyker as the centre of the \neffect, or suffering the effect, every living creature in the area counts as being the psyker who triggered the effect. \nThese effects cannot trigger Perils of the Warp, and if a result indicates rolling on Table 6–3: Perils of the Warp, then \nthere are no psychic effects that Round.\nLOOSE  GRAPNEL\nThe attaching of grapnels can occur in the background as the Explorers ﬁght off the successive waves of Dark Eldar. Numerous voidsmen from the Explorers’ vessel handle this task for them while they defend against the forces of the Splintered Talon. However, things can easily go wrong during this rushed \nprocess, forcing the Explorers to intervene personally in order \nto ﬁx the problem or risk delaying their escape. This includes grapnels coming loose, due to a stray shot from the Dark \nEldar attackers or simple bad luck. In addition to continuing \ncombat, at least one of the Explorers needs to reach the area \nand ﬁx the problem by making a Challenging (+0) Climb \nTest, and then a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test or an \nArduous (–40) Strength Test to set it right. Failure to solve the problem in a timely fashion (within three Rounds) adds 1d5 Rounds to the length of the encounter.\nThe Explorers can attempt an escape once the grapnels \nare in place, though this has to be at the last minute to stop the Dark Eldar from severing the cables. The Explorers make their own escape via shuttle before reuniting with their voidship. The landing craft must then make its way out of the collapsing building, which begins to fall to pieces as The Soul Reaver is wrenched free. The character piloting the \nlander must avoid the falling detritus, and also try to evade \nthe attacks coming from the Dark Eldar on the ground and \nin the gantries. If the GM owns a copy of I\nNTO THE STORM , \nhe can use the vehicle rules from that book to manage this encounter. Alternatively, the situation can be handled more abstractly. The character piloting the landing craft must make a Hard (–20) Pilot (Flyers) Test, and if he succeeds, the craft clears the collapsing fortress and the oncoming ﬁre without incident. If he fails, however, one randomly chosen Explorer suffers 2d10+6 Impact Damage plus an additional 2 Damage for each Degree of Failure on the Test, as a piece of debris smashes through the lander’s hull or a shot from \na heavy weapon sprays the unlucky victim with deadly \nshrapnel. In either case, the lander reaches the voidship and the Explorers return to their vessel.\nby the vessel.

At this same moment, Salaine orders the renegade ﬂeet to move its assault to the next phase, ceasing the long-range bombardment and moving her vessels in to directly attack the holdings and ships of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon, even as the power is fading from the \nRazor’s Web. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:\nAs fragments of the broken ziggurat rain down around it, The \nSoul Reaver is hauled into the sky by your vessel, W arp energy and ﬂames bursting out in a gigantic plume that lights up the night. At the same moment, dozens of ships, both xenos and human, begin to descend on the city to begin their raid in earnest now that the Razor’s W eb has been severed. Rising up to meet them are the sleek vessels of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon. Beyond the ships \nracing towards battle hangs the ragged portal back to the Koronus \nExpanse, blocked by a few score enemy vessels and the ﬁrst salvos of a titanic space battle. \nEven with The Soul Reaver no longer connected to the \nRazor’s Web, the Splintered Talon strikes in full force and a ﬁerce battle erupts above the Nexus between the Dark Eldar ﬂeet and Salaine’s renegades. The Explorers need to ﬁght their way through the space battle and make for the exit from the webway to realspace, as per the original plan. Salaine, now aware of her rival Archon’s connection to the ancient vessel, pushes her forces into battle before Zaergarn can ﬁnd some way to use the power of The Soul Reaver  against her ﬂeet. The run to the exit from the webway \nrequires the Explorers to slip their vessel past the forces of the Splintered Talon as the Kabal’s voidships rise from the Nexus to meet Salaine’s ﬂeet, and then to cross the gap between the two forces, avoiding ﬁre from both sides until they pass their allies and can make for the webway portal.\nBREAKING  THROUGH  THE DARK ELDAR\nThe Explorers can engage any of the Dark Eldar vessels as they break through to head for the portal out of the webway. The Kabal of the Splintered Talon’s ﬂeet is substantial, but it is also unprepared for the Explorers’ vessel swooping in from behind with its prize. To break through the enemy lines, the Explorers travel 45 VUs, during which time they must deal with two Torture-class cruisers and two Corsair-class escorts. One of the Explorers can make a Challenging (+0) Scholastic Lore: \nTactic Imperialis (or Imperial Navy) Test to pinpoint a weak spot in the enemy ﬂeet; on a success, the Explorers may choose whether they wish to contend with to one Torture-\nclass cruiser and three Corsair-class escorts or two Torture-class \ncruisers and one Corsair-class escort instead. The Explorers need only escape these vessels by surviving to travel 45 VUs towards Salaine’s ﬂeet, but the vessels become hostile as soon as the they detect the Explorers and their dark prize.\nAs they pass through the Dark Eldar ﬂeet, Drecarus targets \nthe Explorers’ vessel with a boarding action if he is still alive, and he directs the attack himself (see page 120 for Drecarus’ proﬁle). The boarding party consists of Drecarus, one Wrack per Explorer, and one Grotesque for every two Explorers, plus one Cronos Parasite Engine if any Explorers are Rank 5 or higher (see pages 126-127 for these proﬁles). This boarding \nFRIENDS , FOES, AND OTHERS\nDuring the battle for the Nexus, the Explorers might receive aid from allies they have made along the way, or ﬁnd their plans complicated by the appearance of enemies. Even those ﬁghting with the Explorers have their own agendas, which they want to pursue while the Nexus burns and there is no one to oppose them. The GM does not have to include the actions of every NPC, but can use them to steer the plot as he needs, or to add complications to the Explorers’ plans.\nCULT OF THE FALSE  DAWN\nThese Chaos worshippers try to take the Soul Reaver  for themselves the ﬁrst chance they get. Even once Zaergarn is \ndefeated, they still want to return the vessel to the Screaming Vortex. Until this time, though, they ﬁght against the Splintered Talon if it means getting closer to their goal.\nCONSORVANA  RING\nInterested only in proﬁt, the Cold Traders embark on an expedition of proactive looting during the uprising and help the Explorers only if it helps them work towards this goal. They might even be convinced to help with the assault on the Soul Reaver , provided that the Explorers offer them a chance to pillage its alien treasures.\nRENEGADE  CAPTAINS\nThere may be those among the renegade ﬂeet who have their own agendas, especially those with ties to the Explorers or organisations within the Koronus Expanse. Like the Cold Traders, these captains are out for proﬁt and might choose to abandon the battle for the Nexus to loot the city, or to aid the Explorers if it is worth their while.\nNEUTRAL  DARK ELDAR\nNot all the Dark Eldar are allied with either Salaine or Zaergarn, and some are interested in only escape as the slave uprising threatens their lives. They can become potential allies for the Explorers or avenues of proﬁt if the PCs choose to offer to help them get out of the Nexus alive."

The PCs have to personally ﬁght the raiding party; if they are not aboard their ship, the raid automatically succeeds. If more than half of his \nminions are defeated trying to achieve one objective, Drecarus \nwithdraws and attempts to complete the second objective or \nwreak some other havoc aboard the Explorers’ vessel before trying to escape back to his own craft. If the Explorers fail to stop the raiding party from succeeding at either objective, The \nSoul Reaver crashes down into a random part of the city, and then shortly thereafter reawakens the Razor’s Web targeting the renegade vessels in orbit as Drecarus uses his arcane science to bring the twisted ship under his control.\nCROSSING  NO M AN□S LAND\nOnce beyond the Dark Eldar ﬂeet, the Explorers need to close with their “allies” in the renegade ﬂeet. This is almost as dangerous as breaking through the enemy Dark Eldar vessels, as the PCs are ﬂying straight into a crossﬁre of ordinance and battery ﬁre between the renegade ﬂeet and the enemy Dark \nEldar. This requires them to traverse another 35 VUs, dodging \nnot only the ﬁre of their pursuers but also the stray shots from \ntheir allies (if they cross between a ﬁring ally and an enemy). \nAt this point, if the PCs have made any fast friends or foul enemies in the renegade ﬂeet, these individuals make their play. The Explorers may hail their allies to try to convince them to hold their ﬁre—the Explorers can make a Challenging (+0) \nCharm Test or other appropriate Fellowship-based Test, and on a success convince a single allied vessel to take the risk of momentarily ceasing its barrage. This may be repeated for any number of vessels who might hit them during their desperate ﬂight. Of course, if there are captains in the renegade ﬂeet who hold a grudge against the Explorers for whatever reason, they might choose to deliberately target the Explorers.\nOnce they enter the gap between the fleets, The Soul \nReaver  (driven by the malevolent essence of Zaergarn) sends \nout streams of raw energy in all directions. This affects not just the speed and manoeuvrability of the Explorers’ \nvessel, but also its shields. The Explorers’ vessel suffers a \n–10 penalty on all Tests for Manoeuvre Actions while it is dragging The Soul Reaver. Equally dangerous are the lashing \ntongues of energy coming from The Soul Reaver, and at the \nbeginning of each Strategic Round, these tendrils make 1d5–1 slashing attacks at random vessels within 10 VUs of The Soul Reaver (this includes the Explorers’ vessel) with \nthe profile of a Disintegrator Macrocannon Cluster (see page 136 for this weapon profile).\nTHE M IRROR  CRACKS\nWhen the Explorers have cleared the city and the space battle, there is a very brief moment of calm as it looks like they \nmight actually make it away. The  Soul Reaver suddenly and \ninexplicably grows dim and quiet, the light fading from \nits hull, the chattering of its maddened spirits dying \ndown. Suddenly, there is an explosion of warp energy as Zaergarn exerts what remains of his will to unleash the spirits trapped within The Soul Reaver. The GM should read \nor paraphrase the following:\nYour vessel shudders suddenly and pitches to one side as if struck a blow by a massive object. The sound of tortured metal and snapping plasteel echoes around the ship, and for a moment you are sure the bulkheads are about to part, sending you tumbling out into the void. Then you notice a blazing light from below, ﬂaring up across the vista panels and blinding your sensors. As it dies down, you see that The Soul Reaver has broken free \nand is drifting back down towards the city, surrounded by a burning nimbus of W arp energy. In your mind you can hear Zaergarn Kul cackling madly, along with a thousand, thousand \nother souls all screaming out in silent agony.\nAt this moment, The Soul Reaver breaks free of the Explorers’ \nvessel and begins to drift back towards the city on a river of \npsychic energy. A chaotic cloud of enraged spirits is freed, ﬁlling the void around the alien vessel, and a clear stream of souls is visible coming from the city and the space battle as The Soul Reaver harvests the Warp energy of the dead, turning \nit into raw power. Some of the Razor’s Web also reactivates, and it becomes apparent that Zaergarn is attempting to return The Soul Reaver to the Nexus and use its power to destroy \nthe renegade ﬂeet, his own Kabal’s forces, and anything in range of the guns his wretched and vengeful Warp-echo now controls. The Explorers must destroy Zaergarn and silence The Soul Reaver once and for all lest its unchecked power cost \nthem any chance of salvaging a proﬁt. \nBattle for  \nthe Nexus\nWhen The Soul Reaver ﬁnally stirs from its haunted \nsleep, the ultimate battle for the Nexus begins. On the streets of the city, the slaves are ﬁghting \nfor their lives against their former masters, while in the skies above, Salaine is trying to destroy the vessels of the Splintered Talon. Both of these conﬂicts take place in the background as the Explorers try to destroy The Soul Reaver, though the \nPCs can still play a vital part in turning the tide of battle and choosing who is victorious. The events of the battle continue to unfold even after the Explorers defeat Zaergarn and destroy The Soul Reaver (just because the “dead” Archon is actually \nnow deceased does not stop his Kabal from ﬁghting). The events and encounters detailed in this section can therefore take place either during the Explorers’ attempts to destroy The Soul Reaver or afterward, when they determine the ﬁnal \nvictor in the war for the Nexus. If the Explorers are initially unsuccessful in destroying The  Soul Reaver after Zaergarn \nawakens (see Assaulting The Reaver on page 90), the GM can have the ship come to rest in the city to feed off the souls of the dead. This forces the Explorers to pass through the space battle and then into the midst of the slave uprising, dealing with potential enemies and dangers along the way."

Until the Explorers can ﬁnish off The Soul Reaver and cut its power to the Razor’s Web, her \nﬂeet takes a pounding from the ground defences, and though numerically superior to the vessels of the Splinter Talon, it is slowly losing the engagement. The Explorers can help inﬂuence the outcome of this battle by engaging the Dark Eldar with their own ship and by helping Salaine win key combats, launching boarding actions or taking out important enemy vessels. The GM can use any or all of the encounters below to allow the Explorers a chance to participate in the \nspace battle. Though Salaine does not reject their help, until \nthey have taken out The Soul Reaver, she still insists that this \nis their primary priority. If the Explorers do not complete at least one of the following Encounters, the Kabal of the Splintered Talon defeats Salaine’s renegade ﬂeet.\nREPEL  BOARDERS\nDuring the ﬁghting, Salaine’s own Torture-class cruiser, the Promise of Agony, comes under attack from several Splintered Talon escort vessels, and an elite squad is sent to board her ship in an attempt to kill the Archon (see page 137 for the proﬁle for a Torture-class cruiser). The Explorers notice the situation as they pass, and though Salaine would never stoop to asking for their assistance, they can come to her aid by driving off the boarding vessels or boarding her ship themselves and ﬁghting their way to her side. Salaine’s vessel is under attack by a pair of Corsair-class escorts (see page 137 for Corsair-class escort Proﬁle). The elite squad of killers consists of a group of Wracks twice the number of the Explorers and a Cronos Parasite Engine (see pages 126-127 for the proﬁle for these creatures). The GM should allow the Explorers to resolve this encounter in a number of ways, perhaps by using their own vessel to scatter the boarding ships, leading a counter-assault \nto stop the boarders, or conducting boarding attacks against \nthe enemy escorts to try to set off their reactors or disable their weapons. If the Explorers do not come to Salaine’s aide, her own forces drive off the attack, but not before her ship is crippled and removed from the battle for the Nexus. Further, if the Explorers do assist Salaine and drive off the attackers, they have a chance to show her their effectiveness ﬁrsthand. While few Dark Eldar honour their debts, Salaine is no fool either, and does not making a habit of lightly betraying allies who she does not believe she can dispatch easily. The Explorers gain a +10 bonus to all social interactions with Salaine Morn for the remainder of the adventure if they win something vaguely resembling her grudging respect in this encounter."

A powerful converted Lunar-class cruiser, the Hand is a serious thorn in Salaine’s side until it can be neutralised (the proﬁle for the Lunar-class cruiser can be found on page 196 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook). \nThe Explorers can help the renegade ﬂeet by dealing with it, either taking it on with their own vessel or trying to board and destroy it. As a human vessel, there is also a chance they might turn it to their cause, and persuasive PCs might try \nreasoning with its captain, Maranor Fel (a distant relation of \nthe Fel Dynasty). Maranor hails the Explorers’ vessel when \nhis ship enters the scene, and offers to turn his coat for the \nPCs if they offer him a suitable tribute. Maranor tells the Explorers that if they promise him a signiﬁcant portion of \nthe escaped slaves (once the uprising has been put down), he \ncould be convinced to switch sides. It falls to the Explorers, however, to offer the merciless captain an explanation of how they can get any NPCs they have sold out in this way across to Maranor and back into slavery, and then to execute this \nplan or risk retribution from Maranor and his mighty vessel.\nCOUP DE M AIN\nThe ﬁnal part of the battle to defeat the Splintered Talon’s \nﬂeet involves taking out its ﬂagship, the Torture-class cruiser Voidterror. Salaine wants to personally lead an attack against the ship once it become clear that the renegade ﬂeet is winning, and plans to strike hard and fast onto the vessel’s bridge with a contingent of her best. If the Explorers assisted her when her vessel came under attack, she offers them the privilege of joining her in this glorious victory; if they ignored her plight, she demands that they use their ship to ferry her troops from her own crippled cruiser to the Voidterror, and does not stop them \nfrom accompanying once they begin the assault. Before this ﬁnal assault can begin, however, the Explorers need to knock out the Voidterror’s shadow ﬁeld, the device which keeps its exact location masked from ordinance and boarding craft. This means crippling the ship in void combat, and chasing it through the \nmass of debris and burning hulks which now dominate the \nskies above the Nexus of Shadows. Once the Dark Eldar ship is crippled, Salaine launches an assault craft and makes her landing, and the Explorers can choose to support her. If the Explorers have not permanently dealt with Drecarus yet, this is the point to have him make a ﬁnal stand. The boarding force must cut a swath across Voidterror, facing the ﬁnest of the Kabal of the Splintered \nTalon (four random waves from Table 1–1: Splintered Talon \nForces on page 46 of Chapter I: The Queen of Darkness) before reaching Drecarus, who is backed by one Wrack for each Explorer and a Cronos Parasite Engine (plus one extra Cronos Parasite Engine if the Explorers are of Rank 5 or higher) (see pages 126-127 for the proﬁles for these creatures). \nBefore the encounter begins, Drecarus makes an offer to \nthe Explorers (and to Salaine) to slay the other in exchange \nfor his clemency. Salaine refuses Drecarus’ offer unless the \nExplorers have drawn her ire by trying to kill her, subverting her authority, or making a truly excessive number of snide remarks about her in her presence.\nDuring the combat, Salaine attempts to engage Drecarus \nin single combat, but the Haemonculus eschews close combat when possible, instead putting his minions in between the himself and the Archon while he whittles down the Explorers, starting with those who seem weakest or most vulnerable (see pages 119-120 for the proﬁles for Salaine Morn and Drecarus). As Drecarus falls, he gives a ﬁnal order to his crew to annihilate the intruders and his ship veers violently towards the surface of the Nexus. The Explorers must escape within 4d10 minutes or be trapped aboard the crashing vessel.\nASSAULTING THE REAVER\nFuelled by the souls of the dead, Zaergarn has managed to gain control over the entirety of The Soul Reaver. His spirit is \nenraged at all that is happening around him, and especially at the one behind his assassination (Salaine Morn) and his treacherous ally (Drecarus, who has failed to revive him as their compact dictated). He now moves to direct the power"

A side effect of his “awakening” is that a storm of Warp energy and insane spirits have also been released, creating a powerful Warp barrier around the xenos vessel and lashing out in all directions with their unpredictable energies. The dead Archon is not truly alive, and is no more than a dark reﬂection of the individual he \nonce was. The only way to stop him from using the power of \nThe Soul Reaver to destroy every ship in orbit with the Razor’s \nWeb is to destroy The Soul Reaver or enter the dread ship and \nbanish his twisted memory. The Explorers two options. First, \nthey can either engage The  Soul Reaver in a brutal ship-to-ship \nbattle (see page 138 for The Soul Reaver’s proﬁle). This takes \nplace as part of the space battle, and The  Soul Reaver prioritises \ndefending itself from direct threats like the Explorers while it focuses now reactivated Razor’s Web on the voidships of Drecarus and Salaine. Alternatively the Explorers can force an entry by boarding The  Soul Reaver and ﬁghting their way to \nZaergarn’s chamber once again. Now, however, the halls of The Soul Reaver are not merely ominous, but are ﬁlled with the \nscreaming echoes of the dead that vent their inﬁnite pain on the living. The GM can play out the following encounters in order as the Explorers battle to reach the centre of The Soul \nReaver  and destroy its dark master.UNTO THE BREACH\nThe Explorers need to somehow get aboard The Soul Reaver, \nwhich steadily moves into a low orbit over the Nexus of Shadows after breaking free of their voidship, and then remains there as it trains the guns of the Razor’s Web upon anything in range. This means using shuttles, boarding craft, or assault boats, unless they wish to close the distance between the alien vessel and their own ship to attempt docking. In either case, The Soul Reaver reacts with the utmost hostility to any vessel \nthat draws within 10 VUs, and the Explorers must reach it even as its roaring guns seek to tear their vessel from the sky.\nANIMATED  AND DEADBORN\nAboard The Soul Reaver, the air is ﬁlled with the semi-sentient \nremains of thousands of spirits, their Warp energy tearing at the air and weakening the fabric of the materium. Navigating this storm means dealing with the animated remains of the dead and debris littered throughout the ship. These are not \nactual corpses come to life, for the Warp energies animate \nanything at hand, be it a corpse, fragments of a broken wall, or \nthe shattered remains of the crystalline matrix, forming it into \na weapon against the Explorers. There is also no coordinated attack by the animated objects—the enraged and thoughtless souls lash out at everything around them. The GM can deal with the storm in one of two ways: ﬁrst, some of the animated remains can be fought as foes chosen by the GM from Chapter IV: The Treacherous Path, and count as Kabalite Warriors, Khymerae, or anything the Explorers might have slain over the course of the adventure; alternatively, he can treat the storm as a physical challenge must be overcome, in which case it requires a cumulative 12 Degrees of Success on any number of Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, or Agility Tests representing \nthe Explorers smashing, weaving, and shooting their way \nthrough the maelstrom of malevolent debris. Each Degree of \nFailure that the Explorers score on these Tests while trying \nto reach the requisite Degrees of Success inﬂicts 1d10+3 \nR Damage on each Explorer. Once they break through into the centre of The  Soul Reaver, they enter the eye of the storm \nwhere Zaergarn waits. The stirring souls also affect the wills and psychic powers of the Explorers as detailed in Rising \nStorm on page 86.\nBLOODY  M EMORIES\nIn addition to the random storm of souls and animated debris, the Explorers come face to face with the remains of those they killed early in the adventure (and consequently were devoured by The Soul Reaver). These are not whole spirits or \neven recognisable in any real way, but rather the impression of the dead as part of the Warp storm, only brought to the fore by their thirst for vengeance against the Explorers. During the Animated and Deadborn challenge, a shade of one of \nthese fallen NPCs assaults an Explorer. Only the Explorer under attack is aware of the Warp echo trying to invade his mind. This attack should be resolved with an Opposed Willpower Test between the Explorer and the NPC (using the NPC’s Willpower characteristic). The character who loses the"

This continues once per Round until either the PC is slain (his soul sucked into The  Soul Reaver) or the NPC suffers 25 \npoints of Damage. Only the PC being attacked is aware of the assault, and only he immediately senses it is the shade of an old enemy. Other Explorers with the Psyniscience Skill \nmay make a Difﬁcult (–10) Psyniscience Test to determine \nwhat is happening. Explorers with True Faith Talents or the \nPsyniscience Skill can assist the affected Explorer’s Willpower \nTest, but also suffer any Damage that the affected Explorer \nsuffers from the Tests.THE UNLIVING  ARCHON\nIn the centre of The Soul Reaver, in the same chamber where \nthey were ﬁrst ambushed by his spiritual attack and captured by Drecarus in Chapter I: The Queen of Shadows, the \nExplorers ﬁnally face Zaergarn Kul—or rather, what remains of him. Animated by his formidable strength of will, his corpse has become the centre of the Warp energy coursing through The Soul Reaver. He mocks them and Salaine for \ntheir feeble attempts at trying to take over the Nexus. Read or paraphrase the following aloud when the Explorers enter Zaergarn’s chamber:\nBefore you stands the familiar altar, the stones embedded in it glowing with new, hateful purpose. However, the corpse that once slumped atop it is now upright in front of the pedestal, the body held aloft by a twisted cord of the material that makes up the whole ship. Though rot long ago claimed the corpse, eldritch energy now ﬁlls the long-empty sockets of its eyes and crackles along its warped bones. Though the abomination’s mouth hangs agape, a chilling voice sweeps through the room, resonating from the walls and ﬂoor: “Salaine! Drecarus! Traitors, traitors, all of you! None can be trusted, and all must burn!” With that, a burst \nof crackling light erupts from the gem-encrusted mound and the \ncorpse snaps forward like a puppet on a string, trailed by the twisting column binding it to the pedestal. \nZaergarn is a powerful foe, and death has made him \ncrueller and more twisted than ever. In addition to ﬁghting him and trying to dismember his corpse, the Explorers also have to smash the crystals of The Soul Reaver’s spiritual \nmatrix. Until they do this, every time Zaergarn is reduced to 0 Wounds, he immediately heals completely as he draws power from one of the stones, destroying it (his healing process should be visually apparent to the Explorers as The Soul Reaver feeds its very hull into his body to repair it, \nand even the results of lethal Critical Damage are undone). There are 20 stones in the altar, each with 5 AP and 5 \nWounds, which shatter when reduced to 0 Wounds. Once \nZaergarn sees that the Explorers have ﬁgured out his \nconnection to the stones, he tries to protect them, forcing \nthe Explorers to ﬁght past him to reach them, or making \nthem place themselves in his striking range if they lower their guard to attack a stone. Further, Zaergarn can call other raging, trapped echoes to assist him, and for every fourth stone destroyed, Zaergarn inﬂicts the effects of the Bloody Memories challenge on a single Explorer. The Explorer affected by Bloody Memories can take no other \nactions while afﬂicted by the ethereal assault from some NPC who he slew, justly or otherwise, during the course of the adventure. Zaergarn ﬁnally falls as the last stone shatters, and so too does his control over the devoured souls, which ﬂee into the Warp to whatever ﬁnal fate awaits them. Meanwhile, the walls and crystals of The Soul Reaver  \ngo dark and dead, and the ship either begins to drift in the webway or crashes down into the surface of the Nexus of Shadows, depending on how close to the Gaelan Sphere \nit is when the Explorers banish Zaergarn. The proﬁle for \nZaergarn Kul can be found on page 122."

The \nExplorers share in this dark victory if they sided with \nDrecarus (or another living lord of the Splintered Talon).\nIf the slave rebellion succeeded but the renegade ﬂeet •\t\nwas scattered to the stars (or was victorious but Salaine \nMorn is dead), the slaves hold uncontested control of the Nexus. The Explorers share in this victory so long as they assisted the rebels with at least two encounters in the War of Vengeance section (see page 81).If the slave rebellion failed but the renegade ﬂeet was •\t\nvictorious and Salaine Morn is alive, then Salaine Morn succeeds in her ambitions. If the Explorers did not openly betray her, assisted her with at least one encounter in the War in the Void section (see page 89), and did not \nprovoke her to betray them, they share in her victory.If  the slave rebellion, the renegade ﬂeet’s assault, or •\t\nboth succeeded, but the Explorers have eliminated or removed any NPCs who might contest them for control of the Nexus (Salaine Morn, Drecarus, Anja Shen, Magos Domos, and any prominent Dark Eldar nobles who have been introduced, at the very least), then they claim sole mastery of the Nexus of Shadows, with all of the prestige and danger that such a coup entails.If the slave rebellion succeeded and the renegade ﬂeet won •\t\nthe battle against the forces of the Splintered Talon, then the two factions contest control of the Nexus (see sidebar An Uneasy Peace on page 94 for more details).\nHowever the adventure concludes, and regardless \nof the success or failures of the Explorers, the GM can continue to use the Nexus of Shadows as a locale for his adventures. Its position within the Koronus Expanse, \nhidden away in the webway, makes it an ideal place to \ntrade (most notably for those goods that even Footfall does not stomach), rest, and re-equip for the PCs while \ntravelling the void, regardless of who is its master at the \nend of the day (though, depending on their actions, some \nmasters are more amenable to the Explorers than others). \nREWARDS:\n200 Achievement Points for sparing Anyalra’s life, •\t\nleaving her in the Explorers’ debt.\n200 Achievement Points for stealing •\t The Soul Reaver.\n300 Achievement Points for helping bring about the •\t\ndefeat of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon.300 Achievement Points for helping a single faction to •\t\ngain full control of the Nexus of Shadows.300 Achievement Points for disabling •\t The Soul Reaver \nwithout destroying it.150 Achievement Points for maintaining an alliance with •\t\nSalaine Morn.\n300 Achievement Points for selling their stake in the Nexus •\t\nof Shadows to Salaine Morn or another interested buyer.\n150 Achievement Points for helping to return Brother •\t\nLudvos Tarn to the Imperial Fists.100 Achievement Points for helping Captain Anja Shen •\t\nto reclaim her voidship.100 Achievement Points for securing themselves a •\t\nposition in the Nexus of Shadows Cold Trade.50 Achievement Points for securing trade channels with •\t\nthe Cult of the False Dawn.100 Achievement Points for helping Magos Domos to •\t\nremain and study the Gaelan Sphere as a free man.50 Achievement Points for returning Magos Domos to the •\t\nAdeptus Mechanicus (in lieu of allowing him to stay).50 Achievement Points for each other surviving ally of •\t\nconsequence (any of those not listed above) who remains loyal at the end of the Endeavour (to a maximum of 250).\n500 Achievement Points for claiming sole mastery of •\t\nthe Nexus of Shadows for themselves or their dynasty.\nprovoke her to betray them, they share in her victory.\nprovoke her to betray them, they share in her victory.\nIf  the slave rebellion, the renegade ﬂeet’s assault, or \nIf  the slave rebellion, the renegade ﬂeet’s assault, or \n•\t\nboth succeeded, but the Explorers \nboth succeeded, but the Explorers \nhave eliminated or removed \nany NPCs who might contest \nthem for control of the Nexus \n(Salaine Morn, Drecarus, Anja \nShen, Magos Domos, and any \n300 Achievement Points for disabling \n•\t\nwithout destroying it.\n150 Achievement Points for maintaining an alliance with \n•\t\nSalaine Morn.\n300 Achievement Points for selling their stake in the Nexus \n•\t\nof Shadows to Salaine Morn or another interested buyer.\n150 Achievement Points for helping to return Brother \n•\t\nLudvos Tarn to the Imperial Fists.\n100 Achievement Points for helping Captain Anja Shen \n•\t\nto reclaim her voidship.\n100 Achievement Points for securing themselves a \n•\t\nposition in the Nexus of Shadows Cold Trade.\n50 Achievement Points for securing trade channels with \n•\t\nthe Cult of the False Dawn.\n100 Achievement Points for helping Magos Domos to \n•\t\nremain and study the Gaelan Sphere as a free man.\n50 Achievement Points for returning Magos Domos to the \n•\t\nAdeptus Mechanicus (in lieu of allowing him to stay).\n50 Achievement Points for each other surviving ally of \n•\t\nconsequence (any of those not listed above) who remains \nloyal at the end of the Endeavour (to a maximum of 250).\n500 Achievement Points for claiming sole mastery of \n•\t\nthe Nexus of Shadows for themselves or their dynasty."

If they succeed, however, they gain 6 Proﬁt Factor for the completion of this Grand Endeavour, plus an additional 1 Proﬁt Factor per 100 Achievement Points beyond the 2500 required. Further, if they choose to hold a stake in the Nexus of Shadows (either by sharing victory with the slave rebellion, or by claiming it for themselves alone), the Explorers permanently count their Proﬁt Factor as being 5 higher while within the Nexus of Shadows, to reﬂect their inﬂuence there.\nEXPERIENCE\nThe Explorers have faced daunting challenges and terrible foes, but if they have survived the worst that the Nexus of Shadows could throw at them, their suffering and tribulations have certainly made them stronger:\nLed the planned uprising from the pits: 100 xp•\t\nDefeated Anyalra in battle: 200 xp•\t\nReturned to the •\t Soul Reaver: 200 xp\nDefeated Drecarus (or Salaine) in battle: 200 xp•\t\nDestroyed the •\t Soul Reaver: 100 xp\nDefeated Zaergarn Kul in battle: 250 xp•\t\nMediated between the winning factions: 50 xp•\t\nAN UNEASY  PEACE\nIt is possible that both the slave uprising and the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns under Salaine Morn achieved their primary objectives during this adventure. However, these two groups hold some goals that are mutually exclusive; ﬁrst and foremost, the former slaves wish to remain free and most of them wish to ﬁnd passage off of the Nexus of Shadows, while Salaine would prefer to see them return to captivity so that she may proﬁt by their servitude and suffering. Convincing Salaine to let the freed captives leave is no easy task, and neither is gathering the ships required to move them off of the Nexus. Further, some factions amongst the former slaves may see the city that they helped claim as theirs by right, but no Dark Eldar, least of all Salaine Morn in her ascendency, would share rule with a group of aliens. The entire situation is complicated and dangerous—allies of opportunity, such as the Cold Traders, captains amongst the renegade ﬂeet, and even the Kabal of the Shadowed Thorns and Salaine Morn might betray the Explorers if it is to their advantage, and most of the liberated slaves would die in battle long before they went back to their chains quietly.\nMediating between these two factions is a grand opportunity for the Explorers, but also a great risk, for it \nis impossible to completely please everyone. Negotiations, wheeling and dealing, and treachery as the political war for the Nexus progresses could provide material for Endeavours far beyond the scope of this adventure. As a general rule, however, the more that each faction owes the Explorers, the more likely it is that they are able to convince (or strong-arm) their way to a solution favourable to themselves and to their dynasty.\n94\n94\n94\n94"

The only certain truth is that you saw exactly what they wished you to see.”\n–Relhadhar Antariel, Corsair\nDark Eldar are swift, perceptive, cruel, and accustomed to violence. Each of them is a survivor, having endured an early life in a cut-throat environment where \nmurder is endemic, and each seeks to dominate those around him through a combination of violence and subterfuge. This chapter contains information on creating Dark Eldar Kabalite Warrior Explorers, and also on the many Dark Eldar NPCs \nwho inhabit the dreaded Nexus of Shadows.\nDark Eldar\n“W e are the lords of despair, masters of terror. Dread and agony are \nour meat and wine, and they are plentiful indeed!”\n–Attributed to Asdrubael Vect\nBecause of their cruel nature and strange biology, Dark Eldar characters are recommended for experienced players familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 universe, \nand do not follow the normal rules for character generation described in the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook. In order \nto create a Dark Eldar character, a player must obtain the GM’s permission. GMs should consider carefully the kind of campaign and adventures they intend to run before allowing players to use Dark Eldar characters. This is because, quite aside from their inhuman agility and unnatural hunger, Dark Eldar characters are habitually cruel, violent individuals who seldom regard other species as anything other than tools or \nprey, and thus may not be well suited to particular types of \ncampaigns. Furthermore, being aliens, their presence might \nnot be tolerated by more puritanical characters within the \ncrew, creating complications and conﬂicts that might be interesting in some campaigns but simply disruptive in others. The adventure contained within T\nHE SOUL REAVER  is \ndesigned with opportunities to include a Dark Eldar character, \nand with their particular strengths and foibles in mind.ALIEN BIOLOGY\nEldar anatomy differs from that of humans in a great many ways. To represent their most signiﬁcant differences, a variety of Traits and Talents have been provided, covering their inhuman speed, their hunger for the pain and suffering of others, and so forth. However, there are potentially a limitless variety of ways \nin which the particular genetic and biological makeup of a Dark \nEldar reacts differently from that of a human. A few examples of these differences are covered below. All other possible issues \nthat come up should be discussed with the GM.\nMEDICAL  ATTENTION\nEldar anatomy is more than a little different from that of a \nhuman, and while many equivalent organs exist, the details of their functions differ. Given that the average medicae will be trained ﬁrst and foremost to treat humans, treating a xenos creature of any kind is a challenge, particularly when dealing with a physiology as complex as that of the Eldar. All attempts by a non-Eldar character to use the Medicae Skill on an Eldar \ncharacter of any kind suffer a –10 penalty, though study of \nxenos physiology, represented by training in Forbidden Lore \n(Xenos), removes this penalty.\nThis issue also extends to the use of drugs and stimulants: \nwith a different physiology, human-made stimulants may not have any effect on Eldar, and may in fact have a completely different effect, much as Eldar-made drugs are unlikely to affect humans correctly. For simplicity, assume that human-made drugs have no effect whatsoever on an Eldar unless the Eldar passes a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test, though the GM can rule differently at any time for a particular drug.\nSimilarly, bionics and implants can be problematic. Simply \nput, a bionic built for humans won’t necessarily function properly, if at all, when ﬁtted to an Eldar character, and all examples of bionics and implants of human manufacture should be subject to the GM’s ﬁnal decision. The Dark Eldar tend to favour the ﬂeshcrafter’s art to crude metal augmetics anyway, and most would sooner pay a Haemonculus for surgical augmentation \nthan settle for ungainly human-made implants.\nAPPEARANCES\nAlthough Eldar and humans look far more similar to each \nother than either does to any other alien species common to the Koronus Expanse, this does not mean that Eldar merely look like tall, thin humans with pointy ears. Eldar are taller, more slender, and more poised than humans, moving with a ﬂuid, easy grace that is exceptionally difﬁcult for a human to mimic. Their features are more tapered and pointed, and in the case of Dark Eldar, subtly touched by a savage aspect \nthat makes them appear predatory. The Eldar eyes particularly \nstand out, and can be described as dark, crystalline pools \nwithin which an ageless and utterly alien mind dwells. In all, \nit is quite difﬁcult for an Eldar to pass as a human, or for a human to pass as an Eldar, at least up close. At a distance, when robed and hooded, such a deception may be easier, but it is unlikely to fool anyone for long. An Eldar or a human attempting to pass as the other suffers a –30 penalty to any uses of the Disguise Skill he makes against the Scrutiny Skill of a member of the race he is impersonating."

There are no particular penalties involved in Eldar employing human-made equipment, but human armour will not ﬁt the Eldar comfortably, while human-made weapons generally seem unwieldy. \nTRAITS AND ABILITIES\nAll Dark Eldar characters possess the following Traits, Skills, Talents, and abilities:\nCOMMON  SKILLS\nAll Dark Eldar are familiar with the environment and culture that has surrounded them since birth, whether that birth was natural or otherwise. All Dark Eldar characters gain Common Lore (Dark Eldar) (Int), Speak Language (Dark Eldar) (Int), and Intimidate (S) as Trained Basic Skills.\nKEEN SENSES\nThe Eldar perceive and experience existence with an intensity and clarity beyond that of other creatures, and they can discern the tiniest details with little difﬁculty. Dark Eldar are accustomed to the perpetual gloom and hidden perils of the Dark City.\nAll Dark Eldar characters begin with the Heightened Senses \n(Sight, Hearing) and Paranoia Talents and the Dark Sight Trait.MATCHLESS  GRACE\nAll Eldar are inhumanly quick, capable of astounding feats of agility; there are few things that are as swift of body and mind as an Eldar.\nAll Dark Eldar characters begin with the Catfall and Sprint \nTalents and the Unnatural Agility (x2) Trait.\nNON-IMPERIAL\nThis character was not raised amongst humans, and knows little about the culture and history of the Imperium. The laws, traditions, religion, and superstitions of mankind are unfamiliar and alien to characters with this Trait.\nThe character suffers a –10 penalty on all Common \nLore, Forbidden Lore, and Scholastic Lore Tests relating to the Imperium of Man.\nSOUL □S NEMESIS\nSlaanesh is the bane and doom of the Eldar. Known to the Eldar as She Who Thirsts, this Chaos God is their greatest enemy and the greatest terror the universe holds for all Eldar. To the Dark Eldar, She Who Thirsts is the constant leech upon their souls. Because of Slaanesh, sensation, most especially the suffering of others, tantalises the Dark Eldar, but never truly ﬁlls their hollowed spirits. Compared to the threat of oblivion and the horrors their own souls have created, little holds any dread for the Dark Eldar; the destruction of their souls in the maw of the deity they created is a greater peril than any mortal danger.\nDark Eldar begin play with the Jaded and Dark Soul Talents."

These penalties do not apply when dealing with individuals who have become familiar with him. Finally, the presence of any xenos aboard a human vessel is unsettling for the crew. The continued presence of one or more xenos player \ncharacters aboard a ship reduces its Morale by 2. Furthermore, \nbecause of their dark reputation, if a Dark Eldar character \ninﬂicts suffering on the crew of a vessel to gain Pain Tokens (or \nfor any other reason unjustiﬁable in the eyes of the crew), the ship’s Morale is reduced by 1 for each incident.\nPOWER  THROUGH  PAIN\nTo stave off the slow dwindling of their own withered souls, the Dark Eldar must sup upon the tormented essence of others, devouring their pain and suffering to invigorate the body and renew the spirit. When glutted upon the suffering of others, Dark Eldar are almost unstoppable, gaining supernatural might and becoming heedless of peril.\nA Dark Eldar character gains a single Pain Token whenever \none or more living creatures (in other words, things that are \nnot machines, daemonic, or otherwise “non-living”) within \na number of metres equal to his Perception Bonus are \nkilled, Stunned, suffer non-lethal Critical Damage, \nsuffer Blood Loss, fail a Fear or Pinning Test, or \nare otherwise subjected to excruciating pain \n(gaining a single Pain Token after a set amount of time, depending on the nature and intensity of the pain, at the GM’s discretion). Each time a Dark Eldar character accumulates eight Pain Tokens, he immediately expends them to gain a single temporary Fate Point, which may be spent as normal and vanishes at the end of the session if it goes unused. A Fate Point gained from accumulated Pain Tokens cannot be “burnt.” \nA character may not gain more than one Pain Token from \nany Action or non-Action event (such as the effects of the Crippling, Flame, or Toxic Weapon Qualities, or environmental \neffects) except as noted by certain Vile Pleasures and Talents. \nFor example, non-lethal Critical Damage that also Stuns a \ncreature only grants a single Pain Token, and even a Multiple \nAttacks Action or thrown grenade that harms several enemies \nsimultaneously (or the same foe repeatedly) only yields a single Pain Token for the Action.\nAt the end of any session in which a Dark Eldar character \ndid not gain at least one Pain Token, he suffers 1d5 Willpower Damage (in addition to any other Characteristic Damage from Malignancies as described above in An Alien \nMind), which does not begin to heal in subsequent sessions until he gains at least one Pain Token. \nXENOS  ORIGINS : V ILE PLEASURES\nDifferent Dark Eldar derive different amounts of vigour and satisfaction from the myriad ﬂavours of pain and dread, and each chooses to focus their talents to those ends. Choose one of the following options upon character creation.\nAN ALIEN  M IND\nJust as an Eldar body is different in many ways to a human one, so is an Eldar mind is different to that of humans. The Eldar perceive existence differently to humans, viewing the universe with greater intensity and clarity than the human mind can easily comprehend, and their minds operate at a speed that would be bewildering to a human. They can also reach far greater extremes of emotion and sensation than a human can. The two most signiﬁcant differences are described below. All other possible issues that come up should be discussed with the GM.\nSHE W HO THIRSTS\nWhile the Eldar understand the threat of all the Chaos Gods as being dire, no single entity poses a greater threat to Eldar existence than Slaanesh. With the Dark Eldar, this manifests itself as a leeching of their spirit, a perpetual drain upon their fundamental essence that cannot be stopped, only delayed.

The following additional Skill Group has been added to those available. The manner in which this Skill functions is unchanged.Dark Eldar: Knowledge of the social and political structures of Dark Eldar society, covering the Kabals, the Wych Cults, the Haemonculi Covens, and outsider groups like the Incubi, the Hellions, and even the dreaded Mandrakes. This also comes with an understanding of Dark Eldar nature and history.\nFORBIDDEN  LORE  \n(ADVANCED , INVESTIGATION )\nIntelligence, Skill Group: WebwayForbidden Lore Skills represent knowledge usually hidden, veiled or proscribed by an organisation or society. The following additional Skill Group has been added to those available.

As many routes through the webway are blocked, \nsealed or simply closely guarded secrets, and because \nthe webway itself does not connect to every world, \nthere may be many destinations that simply \ncannot be reached in a single trip, if at all.SPEAK  LANGUAGE  (A DVANCED )\nIntelligence, Skill Group: Dark EldarSpeak Language is used to communicate with others using the same language. The following additional Skill Group has been added to those available.

In addition, when wielding any \nweapon which has the Toxic Quality, the Dark Eldar adds his \nIntelligence Bonus to the weapon’s Damage.

As a society driven by the whims of its capricious and merciless overlords, the chosen tools of the wealthy and powerful vary based purely on the ephemeral notion of which methods of murder are fashionable at the \ntime, while those struggling to survive continue to employ \ntheir limited means in the most vicious ways possible.\nThis section serves two purposes. The ﬁrst is to provide \nan arsenal of appropriate weaponry and armour for Kabalite Warrior player characters, and others looking for an elegant or exotic way to kill. The second is to serve as an accompaniment for the Dark Eldar NPCs presented later, detailing all manner of unusual weapons that may be used against the Explorers during this adventure.AVAILABILITY\nAll weapons listed in this section have their availability listed as appropriate for a character seeking items from Dark Eldar settlements—useful for determining a Kabalite Warrior’s starting equipment, or for obtaining goods found within the Nexus of Shadows or even the Dark City itself.\nOutside of these limited situations, Dark Eldar war gear \nis signiﬁcantly harder to ﬁnd. Reduce the availability of all items within this section by four steps if an Explorer is seeking them outside of a Dark Eldar haven—a Common item becomes Very Rare, while a Rare item becomes Unique. \nItems of Very Rare, Extremely Rare, Near-Unique and Unique \navailability should all be treated as Unique, if they are to be \nmade available at all.\nNEW QUALITIES\nThe following are new weapon qualities which apply to numerous Dark Eldar weapons and attacks found in these appendices:\nCRIPPLING  (X)\nParticularly cruel or deadly weapons sometimes include things like living barbs or shards that remain in their victims’ wounds, causing them immense pain and even slowly killing them. When a target suffers at least one Damage (after reductions for Armour and Toughness Bonus) from a weapon with the Crippling Quality, it counts as being “Crippled” for the remainder of the encounter or until healed of all Damage. If a Crippled character takes more than a Half Action on a single turn, that character suffers Rending Damage equal to the number in parenthesis (X). This damage is not reduced by Armour or Toughness Bonus.\nFELLING  (X)\nDesigned to puncture and to mangle, Felling weapons are capable of toppling even the mightiest foes. If the weapon hits, it ignores a number of levels of Unnatural Toughness possessed by the target equal to the number in parenthesis. For instance, a Felling (1) weapon ignores the beneﬁts of Unnatural Toughness (x2) and would reduce the beneﬁts of Unnatural Toughness (x3) by one multiplier.\nPROVEN  (X)\nWeapons with the Proven Quality always inﬂict signiﬁcant injuries and treat any die roll for Damage lower than the value in parenthesis as if it were that number instead. For instance, a Proven (3) weapon treats any die roll of 1 or 2 as 3 for the purposes of calculating Damage.\nRAZOR -SHARP\nThe shearing edge of this weapon can glide through the most advanced armour as though it were primitive tin. When rolling to attack with this weapon, if the attack roll results in two or more Degrees of Success, double the weapon’s Penetration for that attack."

The wretched creature could not have known how near death it truly was.”\n–Sarik Heshaq, on a fellow Kabalite Warrior’s kill-log\nWhile most Dark Eldar are consummate melee combatants, many choose to deliver death from a distance, often out of a sense of self-preservation or a \ndisdain for their foes. Even those who favour the swirling furore of melee combat are frequently inclined to bring some form of sidearm with them to battle, to cut down those who ﬂee or deliver a ﬁnal insult to an adversary unworthy of knife-work.\nThe many and varied guns of the Dark Eldar are as \ncruel and vicious in effect as their masters, ranging from the envenomed needles of a splinter riﬂe to the thorough \nannihilation wrought by a dark lance.KABALITE WEAPONS\nSPLINTER  W EAPONS\nSplinter weapons ﬁre shards of splintered crystal using \na powerful magnetic pulse. These shards are covered in incredibly virulent and fast-acting toxins that can ensure a painful death or incapacitate a would-be slave. The favoured armament of the Kabalite Warrior is the splinter riﬂe, often ﬁred on the move from the balustrade of a Raider or Venom transport. The splinter pistol, its handheld cousin, is an elegant sidearm beloved of assassins and street ﬁghters across the Dark City and the Nexus of Shadows alike; although designed for precision short-ranged shots, the toxins inside its reservoir \npod are no less deadly. Some Dark Eldar become so enthralled \nby the distorted grimaces of agony that their weapons inﬂict that they employ larger and more potent splinter weapons. \nAmongst these is the shardcarbine, a favourite of Scourges \nand Trueborn, and the splinter cannon, capable of mowing \ndown an entire mob of panicking prey in one volley.\nMost Splinter weapons are ﬁtted with razor-sharp blades \nthat serve both as adornment and weapon. A splinter pistol \nwith such blades may be treated as a mono-knife in close combat, while a splinter riﬂe or shardcarbine ﬁtted with blades is treated as a mono-spear (see page 131 of the R\nOGUE \nTRADER  Core Rulebook for Primitive Melee Weapons).\nSplinter cannons are often ﬁtted with suspensor pods and \nanti-gravity stabilisers that allow highly mobile warriors to use it more effectively on the move or keep it trained on a target for a longer period of time. A splinter cannon with these upgrades is Very Rare instead of Rare, but confers the Auto-Stabilised Trait for any shots he makes with it.\nELDAR  PLASMA  GRENADES\nThe Eldar long ago reﬁned the use of plasma in weaponry, creating devices that are stable and safe to use while still proving effective against the enemy. Their plasma grenades are a case in point—where human-made plasma warheads rely on the unstable and destructive nature of uncontained plasma, Eldar plasma grenades unleash a precise pulse of heat and electromagnetic force that not only burns, but also leaves foes disoriented.\nTable 4—2: Kabalite Weapons\nSplinter Weapons\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\n wt Availability\nShardcarbine† Basic 60m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Storm, Toxic 3 kg Scarce\nShardcarbine† Basic 60m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Storm, Toxic 3 kg Scarce\nSplinter \nCannon†\nHeavy 110m –/–/10 1d10+5 R 4 300 3 Full Tearing, Toxic\nHeavy 110m –/–/10 1d10+5 R 4 300 3 Full Tearing, Toxic\nHeavy 110m –/–/10 1d10+5 R 4 300 3 Full Tearing, Toxic\nHeavy 110m –/–/10 1d10+5 R 4 300 3 Full Tearing, Toxic\nHeavy 110m –/–/10 1d10+5 R 4 300 3 Full Tearing, Toxic\n15 \nkg\nRare\nSplinter Pistol† Pistol 50m S/3/– 1d10+2 R 3 120 2 Full Toxic\nSplinter Pistol† Pistol 50m S/3/– 1d10+2 R 3 120 2 Full Toxic\n 1 kg Common\nSplinter Riﬂe† Basic 80m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Toxic\nSplinter Riﬂe† Basic 80m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Toxic\nSplinter Riﬂe† Basic 80m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Toxic\nSplinter Riﬂe† Basic 80m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Toxic\nSplinter Riﬂe† Basic 80m S/3/5 1d10+2 R 3 200 2 Full Toxic\n2.5 \nkg\nAverage\nGrenades\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\n wt Availability\nEldar Plasma \nGrenade\nThrown SBx3 S/–/– 1d10+6 E 4 – – Blast (4), Shocking\nThrown SBx3 S/–/– 1d10+6 E 4 – – Blast (4), Shocking\n0.5 \nkg\nCommon\n†These weapons have additional rules as described in their entries.\n†These weapons have additional rules as described in their entries."

Darklight reacts explosively with the true matter of the universe, leaving only smouldering desolation where the beam touches. So volatile is this substance that the tiniest fractions of a microgram \nare employed with every shot, for any greater quantities could \nenact untold devastation, and each containment cell holds only the tiniest mote of Darklight, locked within powerful wards and ﬁelds. To even look upon Darklight unprotected is to scar the eyes forever with its impossible radiance, a vile luminescence that is painful to behold caused by the corrupting inﬂuence of the Darklight upon the true light surrounding.\nThe Dark Eldar employ numerous forms of Darklight \nweaponry, including colossal torpedoes of horriﬁc power, but the most common are portable devices capable of savage and precise devastation: the blast pistol, the blaster, and the dark lance. Any of these can shred through the toughest of armour and inﬂict horriﬁc wounds upon the ﬂesh of the living as tiny specks of Darklight create powerful detonations within the matter they touch.DISINTEGRATOR  CANNON\nUtilising tiny quantities of plasma stolen from enslaved suns, the disintegrator cannon is a sophisticated weapon, remaining cool to the touch even after a sustained barrage in spite of the boiling energies within. Disintegrator cannons are most commonly encountered mounted onto vehicles like Raiders and Ravagers.\nHEAT LANCE\nThese powerful devices combine the focus and precision of laser weaponry with the searing potency of melta weaponry, creating a weapon able to melt armour plate from further away than most comparable meltaguns, but with the ﬁne precision of the most ﬁnely-honed Eldar laser weapon.\nA heat lance doubles its Penetration value when ﬁred at \ntargets that are within Short Range and closer.\nHEXRIFLE\nThousands of years ago, the Dark City found itself host to a plague of a quite unusual nature. While the plague itself has long since been stopped, samples of the disease still exist in phials within the laboratories of Haemonculi, to employ as a weapon against their enemies. Each hexriﬂe is unique, created for an individual Haemonculus to deliver this potent and exotic plague \nTable 4—3: Exotic Dark Eldar Ranged Weapons\nDarklight Weapons\nDarklight Weapons\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\n wt Availability\nwt Availability\nBlast Pistol Pistol 20m S/–/– 2d10+5 X 16 6 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (2) 2 kg Rare\nBlast Pistol Pistol 20m S/–/– 2d10+5 X 16 6 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (2) 2 kg Rare\nBlaster\n Basic 60m S/–/–\n2d10+10 \nX\n16 18 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (3) 4 kg Rare\n16 18 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (3) 4 kg Rare\n16 18 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (3) 4 kg Rare\n16 18 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (3) 4 kg Rare\n16 18 3 Full Felling (1), Proven (3) 4 kg Rare\nDark Lance Heavy 140m S/–/–\n2d10+16 \nX\n16 36 4 Full Felling (1), Proven (4)\n16 36 4 Full Felling (1), Proven (4)\n16 \nkg\nVery Rare\nOther Exotic Ranged Weapons\nOther Exotic Ranged Weapons\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\nName Class Range RoF Damage Pen Clip Rld Special\n wt Availability\nDisintegrator \nCannon\nHeavy 140m –/–/5 1d10+12 E 12 30 4 Full –\nHeavy 140m –/–/5 1d10+12 E 12 30 4 Full –\nHeavy 140m –/–/5 1d10+12 E 12 30 4 Full –\nHeavy 140m –/–/5 1d10+12 E 12 30 4 Full –\nHeavy 140m –/–/5 1d10+12 E 12 30 4 Full –\n30 \nkg\nVery Rare\nHeat Lance† Basic 50m S/–/– 1d10+15 E 15 10 2 Full Accurate\nHeat Lance† Basic 50m S/–/– 1d10+15 E 15 10 2 Full Accurate\n 6 kg Very Rare\nHexriﬂe† Basic 180m S/–/– 1d10+1 I 2 1 3 Full Accurate, Felling (2) 5 kg Unique\nHexriﬂe† Basic 180m S/–/– 1d10+1 I 2 1 3 Full Accurate, Felling (2) 5 kg Unique\nHexriﬂe† Basic 180m S/–/– 1d10+1 I 2 1 3 Full Accurate, Felling (2) 5 kg Unique\nHexriﬂe† Basic 180m S/–/– 1d10+1 I 2 1 3 Full Accurate, Felling (2) 5 kg Unique\nHexriﬂe† Basic 180m S/–/– 1d10+1 I 2 1 3 Full Accurate, Felling (2) 5 kg Unique\nHexriﬂe† Basic 180m S/–/– 1d10+1 I 2 1 3 Full Accurate, Felling (2) 5 kg Unique\nLiquiﬁer Gun† Basic 20m S/–/– 2d10+2 I Special 2 2 Full Flame, Toxic 4 kg Extremely Rare\nLiquiﬁer Gun† Basic 20m S/–/– 2d10+2 I Special 2 2 Full Flame, Toxic 4 kg Extremely Rare\nPhantasm Grenade \nLauncher†\nBasic 30m S/2/– – – 6 6 Full –\nBasic 30m S/2/– – – 6 6 Full –\nBasic 30m S/2/– – – 6 6 Full –\nBasic 30m S/2/– – – 6 6 Full –\nBasic 30m S/2/– – – 6 6 Full –\n 4 kg Rare\n4 kg Rare\nShredder Basic 60m S/–/– 2d10+5 R 2 12 2 Full\nShredder Basic 60m S/–/– 2d10+5 R 2 12 2 Full\nReliable, Blast (3), \nTearing\n2 kg Rare\nStinger Pistol Pistol 30m S/–/– 1d10+2 R 3 18 2 Full Felling (1), Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nStinger Pistol Pistol 30m S/–/– 1d10+2 R 3 18 2 Full Felling (1), Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nStinger Pistol Pistol 30m S/–/– 1d10+2 R 3 18 2 Full Felling (1), Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nStinger Pistol Pistol 30m S/–/– 1d10+2 R 3 18 2 Full Felling (1), Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nStinger Pistol Pistol 30m S/–/– 1d10+2 R 3 18 2 Full Felling (1), Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nStinger Pistol Pistol 30m S/–/– 1d10+2 R 3 18 2 Full Felling (1), Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\n†These weapons have additional rules as described in their entries."

Crystalline \ncylinders containing the tiniest quantity of the disease are ﬁred from the riﬂes, shattering upon impact and exposing the target to the plague. For all but the hardiest of victims, this momentary exposure is sufﬁcient for the plague to begin its vile work, \nturning ﬂesh and bone into glass and leaving a transparent, \nﬂawless statue where once was a living creature.\nAny living creature (but not daemons or machines) that \nsuffers one or more Wounds from a hexriﬂe after reductions \nfor any Armour and Toughness Bonus must immediately pass a \nHard (–20) Toughness Test or immediately lose the affected \nbody part as it is transformed into glass, suffering all the usual effects of a lost limb (including death if the affected body part is his head or body). If the character fails this Test by three or more Degrees of Failure, he is simply slain outright as his entire body succumbs to the crystalline plague. A character who burns a Fate Point to survive such a demise crystallises only partially, and is rendered unconscious for 1d10+5 minutes as his body miraculously ﬁghts off the disease.\nLIQUIFIER  GUN\nThis baroque collection of pipes and tubes projects a torrent of highly corrosive ﬂuids that can melt through anything it touches. Typically carried by Grotesques, Wracks, and other servants of the Haemonculi, these weapons are most commonly fuelled by the corrosive ichor that passes for blood in such creatures. The devastation wreaked by a liquiﬁer gun’s noxious payload depends entirely on how much of the ﬂuid splashes across a target.\nWhile not strictly a Flame weapon, a liquiﬁer gun \nfunctions in almost exactly the same way, including a \nchance of being set aﬂame—in truth, this represents a \nquantity of the corrosive liquid lingering on the target \nand continuing to eat away at ﬂesh and armour, and thus \ndeals 1d10 I Damage with the Toxic Quality, in place of the normal Damage from ﬁre. The Penetration value of a liquiﬁer gun increases by 2 for every Degree of Failure on a character’s Agility Test to avoid it—the greater the failure, the greater the quantity of acid that strikes the target and thus the faster it eats away at any armour. A Liquiﬁer Gun inbuilt into a Dark Eldar monstrosity such as a Wrack or Fleshwrought Drake never needs to be reloaded, but causes its user 1d5 I Damage that is not reduced by Armour or Toughness Bonus each time he ﬁres it as he spews out the toxic substance that passes for blood in his twisted body.\nPHANTASM  GRENADE  LAUNCHER\nThese back-mounted weapons project volleys of tiny, explosive discs that unleash a ﬁne mist of psychotropic vapours, the slightest whiff of which can cause terrible nightmares. Anyone within 10 metres of these grenades’ point of impact must pass a Difﬁcult \n(–10) Toughness Test or roll on Table 10–4: The Shock \nTable  on page 294 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook, \nadding an additional +10 to the result for every Degree of Failure on the Toughness Test. Phantasm Grenade Launchers may never be loaded with other types of grenades.SHREDDER\nThe shredder unleashes an expanding mesh of monoﬁlaments with miniscule barbs along their length. The mesh entangles the victim in an invisible net that slices apart the target as it struggles.\nSTINGER  PISTOL\nA wicked weapon with a cruel purpose, a stinger pistol delivers horrifyingly deadly toxins via the thin needles that it ﬁres.\nMelee \nWeaponry\n“The caress of cold steel upon warm ﬂesh is a divine gift, a sensation unmatched in all of existence in its purity and simplicity. I have drunk deep of its echoes in more opponents than I care to count, but have never felt the sensation itself. Will you be the ﬁrst to gift me with the experience, or shall you be another through whom I must feel this gift vicariously?”\n–Attributed to Lelith Hesperax\nTo look an enemy in the eyes as they die is highly regarded amongst the Dark Eldar, and though all manner of subterfuge and trickery may be employed to reach the \nmoment itself, the act of murder is regarded as amongst the most intimate things two individuals can share. To face an enemy in close combat is viewed by most Dark Eldar as the simplest way to feed well, and the streets of Commorragh run crimson with the blood of those too weak to maintain the cruel stalemate between paranoid awareness and sadistic hunger.\nFor the wealthy and powerful Dark Eldar, however, simple \nblades are the toys of children. Envenomed blades dripping \nwith necrolixirs and vitriolic ointments, talons and lashes that \nspark with a malicious energy, and devices more esoteric still are beloved implements of murder and dominance, symbols of prestige and personal might.\nof highly corrosive ﬂuids that can melt through anything \nit touches.

Agonisers come in a variety of forms, with the most common being whips and barbed ﬂails, though talon-ﬁngered gauntlets are also favoured. Best Craftsmanship agonisers also cause 1d5 permanent Perception Damage in addition to their other effects whenever they inﬂict Critical Damage on a living creature.\nELECTROCORROSIVE  W HIP\nAn electrocorrosive whip is a lashing tongue of venom-soaked polymer with a high-yield neuroelectric generator in its handle. The merest touch is painful in the extreme, and leaves foes debilitated and enfeebled by both toxin and electrical shock.\nAny creature that suffers one or more Damage from an \nelectrocorrosive whip, after reduction from Armour and Toughness Bonus, also suffers 1d10 Strength Damage.FLESH  GAUNTLET\nA clawed glove ﬁtted with far too many syringe-like spines and serum-ﬁlled vials, the ﬂesh gauntlet can inject potent electrosteroids that force rapid, unnatural, and uncontrollable growth. Its victim will literally outgrow his own skin, bursting apart in a welter of streaming, heaving matter, and leaving little more than a pile of twitching overgrown muscle, ruptured skin, and shattered bone. The deadliness of the weapon is hardly offset by the fact that many models require a short period of time to prepare a new batch of electrosteroids after each use. \nAny creature that fails the Toughness Test caused by \na ﬂesh gauntlet’s Toxic Quality suffers 2d10+5 Rending Damage that ignores Armour and Toughness Bonus, instead \nof the normal 1d10 Impact Damage, as its body rapidly \nexpands and tears itself apart. As it is specially engineered to deliver its particular lethal concoction, a ﬂesh gauntlet may \nnever be loaded with a new toxin, as discussed in The Toxic \nSpectrum on page 117. Finally, after causing a Toughness \nTest with its special Toxic Quality, a ﬂesh gauntlet must be \nre-calibrated to churn out more of its vile brew; once it has been depleted, it loses the Toxic Quality until its wielder spends a Half Action to make a successful Ordinary (+10) Chem-Use or Tech-Use Test.\nTable 4—4: Dark Eldar Exotic Melee Weapons\nName Class Range Damage Pen Special\nName Class Range Damage Pen Special\n wt Availability\nAgoniser Lash† Melee 3m 1d10+3 E 6\nAgoniser Lash† Melee 3m 1d10+3 E 6\nFlexible, Power Field, \nFlexible, Power Field, \nTearing, Shocking\nTearing, Shocking\n2 kg Rare\nAgoniser Talon† Melee – 1d10+4 E 7\nPower Field, Tearing, \nPower Field, Tearing, \nShocking\nShocking\n2 kg Rare\nElectrocorrosive \nWhip†\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nMelee 3m 1d10+4 R 8 Flexible, Shocking 2 kg Rare\nFlesh Gauntlet† Melee – 1d10+3 R 2 Toxic, Unbalanced 5 kg Extremely Rare\nHellglaive† Melee – 1d10+5 R 3 Razor-Sharp\nHellglaive† Melee – 1d10+5 R 3 Razor-Sharp\n 4 kg Scarce\nHusk Blade† Melee – 1d10+ 3 R 7\nBalanced, Felling (1), Power \nField\n3 kg Unique\nHydra \nGauntlets†\nMelee – 1d10+2 R 2 Tearing\nMelee – 1d10+2 R 2 Tearing\n 1.5 kg Very Rare\nImpaler† Melee – 1d10+3 R 3 Razor-Sharp\n 2 kg Rare\nMindphase \nGauntlet†\nMelee – 1d10 I 0 –\nMelee – 1d10 I 0 –\n 4 kg Very Rare\nRazorﬂail Melee 3m 1d10+2 R 3 Flexible, Razor-Sharp 3 kg Rare\nReaver’s Fang† Melee – 2d5 R 2 Felling (1), Tearing, Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nReaver’s Fang† Melee – 2d5 R 2 Felling (1), Tearing, Toxic 1 kg Extremely Rare\nShardnet†\nMelee/\nThrown\n5m 2d5 R 1\nFlexible, Snare, Crippling \n(1d5), Shocking\n3 kg Rare\nVenomblade Melee – 1d10+4 R 2 Balanced, Felling (1), Toxic 2 kg Extremely Rare\nVenomblade Melee – 1d10+4 R 2 Balanced, Felling (1), Toxic 2 kg Extremely Rare\nWych Knife† Melee – 1d10 R 3 Razor-Sharp\n 0.5 kg Scarce\n†These weapons have additional rules as described in their entries."

As weapons, they are no less useful—a hellglaive’s balance and razor-sharp blades allow a Hellion to strike down multiple enemies with every pass, if he is sufﬁciently skilled.\nHellglaives are designed to be used as two-handed \nweapons with a pair of striking ends. As such, a character \nwielding a hellglaive in two hands always counts as being \narmed with a pair of weapons with its proﬁle (one in each \nhand) and follows all of the rules for Two-Weapon Fighting \nfound on page 246 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook. \nA hellglaive’s utility to a skyboard rider grants the wielder a +10 bonus to all Pilot (Personal) Tests.\nHUSK BLADE\nAppearing as if made of cracked and pitted bone, a husk blade leaves faint smoke trails as it passes through the air, and instantly evaporates any moisture that comes into contact with its blade. Victims slashed or stabbed by such a blade are reduced to shrivelled corpses that turn to dust in moments, and even those lucky enough to only suffer a glancing hit ﬁnd much of their vitality dragged away by these deadly weapons.\nAny living creature that suffers one or more Wounds \nfrom a Husk Blade, after reductions from any Armour and Toughness Bonus, also suffers 2d10+5 Toughness Damage. \nAny living creature that suffers Critical Damage from a husk \nblade is immediately slain, turning to dust almost instantly, its \nﬂesh outlived by the echoes of its dying scream.\nHYDRA  GAUNTLETS\nThese outlandish weapons are the deﬁning tools of Hydrae, \nand the bladed gauntlets they wield are said to have been forged beyond the petty conﬁnes of reality, in some strange and distant pocket of existence. The blades on each gauntlet are grown from a strange crystalline substance that continually renews itself, sprouting new blades to replace those shorn off or blunted.\nHydra gauntlets are only ever equipped in pairs by Hydra \nWyches, and though one could theoretically be used alone, it would be both uncouth and far less effective. When a character equipped with a pair of Hydra Gauntlets makes an All-Out Attack Action, that character may spend his Reaction to make an additional attack with each Hydra gauntlet for every three Degrees of Success on the original Weapon Skill Test made as a part of the All-Out Attack Action.IMPALER\nAn impaler is unremarkable in itself, a simple twin-bladed short-spear that can be rammed deep into the body of a victim. Impalers are seldom used alone, and most of those who wield them are Yraqnae, who use them in conjunction with shardnets.\nIn the hands of those not used to its subtleties, an impaler \nmerely counts as a mono-spear (see page 131 of the R\nOGUE \nTRADER  Core Rulebook for Primitive Melee Weapons), \nbut inﬂicts no penalties for using it this way so long as the wielder has the Melee Weapons Training (Primitive) Talent.\nMINDPHASE  GAUNTLET\nLess a weapon and more a control device, mindphase gauntlets can stop a creature in its tracks with a single touch. A ﬂeeting moment’s contact is sufﬁcient for the gauntlet’s discharge to paralyse muscle and dull the mind.\nA creature struck by a mindphase gauntlet must \nimmediately make a Challenging (+0) Strength Test and a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test. If it fails either Test, the \ncreature is Stunned for 1 Round and gains a level of Fatigue \nfor every Degree of Failure. If it fails both Tests, add together \nthe Degrees of Failure from both Tests to determine how \nmany levels of Fatigue the creature gains.\nRAZORFLAIL\nThe deﬁning tool of the Lacerai, razorﬂails are lightweight \nswords composed of a number of interlocking blades joined by a cable. At a moment’s notice, these blades can be separated, turning a sword into a many-bladed lash. In the hands of a skilled wielder, these are almost impossible to parry and can be woven past almost any defence. Razorﬂails are commonly wielded \nin pairs, the Wych surrounding herself with a \nswirling wall of deadly blades as she dances across the battleﬁeld.\nREAVER □S FANG\nThe nobles of the Bonespires believe that there is a perfect insult to accompany each death, and a perfect poison to cause it. Reaver’s fangs’ triple-pronged blades are designed to suit the latter need.\nAll-Out Attack Action, that character may \nspend his Reaction to make an additional \nattack with each Hydra gauntlet for every \nthree Degrees of Success on the original \nWeapon Skill Test made as a part of \nthe All-Out Attack Action.\nR\nE\nR\nE\nR\n A\nVE\nA\nVE\nA\n R\n□\nS\nThe nobles of the Bonespires believe that there is a \nperfect insult to accompany each death, and a perfect \npoison to cause it.

However, only one \nvenom can do its dark work at a time, and so the weapon’s user must choose only one venom to be in effect before each \nattack he makes.\nSHARDNET\nShardnets are a wire mesh covered in tiny barbs that dig \ninto ﬂesh and tear with every moment of struggle, while simultaneously administering electrical shocks that render a victim incapable of self-defence and cause him to jerk and twitch against the barbed net.\nA shardnet’s Crippling Damage continues only while the \ntarget is immobilised by the Snare Quality, but will trigger \nevery time the target attempts to get free, which in turn may \ncause the Shocking Quality to take effect again.\nVENOMBLADE\nThis weapon is a common sign of wealth and power amongst the Dark Eldar aristocracy. Each venomblade has thousands of microscopic pores that continually exude a distilled cocktail of hypertoxins. The slightest scratch from a venomblade is sufﬁcient to fell even the mightiest of foes.\nWYCH KNIFE\nAt ﬁrst glance, there is little to distinguish these blades from a commoner’s knife or a Kabalite Warrior’s ﬂaying blade. However, subtle details of their construction, such as the pattern of serrations, the precise curvature of the blade, or the placement of perforations, inﬂuence their balance and the cuts they inﬂict so that in the hands of an expert they can inﬂict grievous wounds and ﬁnd the weaknesses in all but the toughest armour.\nA character not proﬁcient in the use of a wych knife counts \nthe weapon as a mono-knife in all respects (see page 131 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook for Primitive Melee \nWeapons), rather than using the listed proﬁle, but suffers no penalties for using it this way so long as he has the Melee Weapons Training (Primitive) Talent.Armour and \nForce Fields\n“There is no ﬁner armour than fear; fear will stay a blade before the will to strike is fully-formed, and makes physical armour into a needless burden.”\n–Final words of Lord Heirax\nSwift and arrogant they may be, but the Dark Eldar are not oblivious to the beneﬁts of armour, and while they favour light-weight harnesses that do not impede their \nnatural swiftness, it is rare even for the prideful and graceful Wyches to take to battle unclad. Those who do enter battle \nwithout armour are more arrogant than most, and history \ntells whether they were mistaken in their assumptions of invulnerability.\nXENOHIDE  CLOTHING\nCrafted from the ﬂayed hides of arena beasts or slaves (living or dead), these garments are common clothing amongst the Dark Eldar of the Nexus of Shadows. The toughened nature of the material helps ward off would-be murderers and other common hazards of the Bonespires and the Shadow Arteries alike.\nKABALITE  ARMOUR\nThese suits of segmented plates are commonly worn by Kabalite Warriors of all kinds, from the half-born murderers who have dragged themselves up from the depths of Commorragh to the sneering Trueborn in their palatial spires. Each suit of armour is held in place by a variety of barbs and hooks that dig deep into the wearer’s ﬂesh and play against his nerve bundles. His senses heightened by his own pain, the \nsimple act of donning this armour prepares him for battle. \nAny individual not accustomed to wearing such armour must \nmake a Challenging (+0) Toughness or Willpower Test \nwhen donning it to avoid gaining a level of Fatigue and frequently expressing displeasure at the tearing barbs through curses, complaints, or whimpers.\nWYCHSUIT\nWychsuits and similar garments are little more than ﬂexible bodysuits, adorned in an eclectic manner with armoured plates and reinforced panels. Those worn by Wyches often provide protection only to the side of their bodies that they habitually turn towards the enemy, while Hellions commonly wear armoured collars and vambraces, and many Reavers favour masked cowls and heavily padded shoulders. Regardless, it is difﬁcult to strike a Dark Eldar warrior past even the tiny \namounts of armour that these suits provide."

The expense of a single suit of ghostplate is such that only the wealthiest and most influential Dark Eldar can obtain it. Each suit is further reinforced by a force field.\nGhostplate has a ﬁeld with a Protection Rating of 20, but \noverloads after shielding against the attack if its user rolls doubles on any roll to deﬂect an incoming attack.\nSHADOW  FIELD\nA shadow ﬁeld is an arcane Dark Eldar device that creates a defence that is virtually impossible to pierce. Projecting a dark miasma of energy around the wearer, the ﬁeld is proof against almost any attack, and the warrior within cannot be easily targeted. However, should one manage to penetrate this miasmic aura, the ﬁeld’s instability causes it to collapse almost immediately.\nA shadow ﬁeld is a force ﬁeld with a Protection Rating of \n80. However, should any roll against that Protection Rating be higher than the Protection Rating, the ﬁeld immediately fails and does not provide any further protection until \nrepaired. Repairing the ﬁeld requires delicate calibrations, \nand it cannot be used again until the user or another character spends at least an hour working on it and succeeds at a Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use Test outside of combat.CLONE  FIELD\nIn place of coherent ﬁelds of energy, a clone ﬁeld projects holographic duplicates of the wearer, all identical in aspect and moving in perfect and lifelike synchrony. Only through trial and error can the true wearer be identiﬁed, and few combatants have the time to ﬁnd the real threat amidst a \nswarm of falsehoods.\nDue to the shifting duplicates surrounding the wearer, \nhe may re-roll one failed Dodge Test per Round while the \nclone ﬁeld is active, and he may make a single additional \nDodge Test each round that does not expend one of his \navailable Reactions. Further, the wearer doubles all Degrees \nof Success on successful Dodge Tests. A clone ﬁeld cannot be used to evade the attacks of creatures that do not rely on sight as a primary sense. Clone ﬁelds do provide direct protection, and thus do not overload.\nFORCE  FIELD  RULES\n“Fields” cover a broad range of technologies across the galaxy, but all personal defence ﬁelds are devices that protect their user from the attacks of enemies. A character can only beneﬁt from one ﬁeld at a time, regardless of how many different ﬁelds he may have \nequipped. When a character wearing an active ﬁeld is \nhit, roll 1d100. If the result is lower than or equal to the \nﬁeld’s Protection Rating, the hit is nulliﬁed and has no \neffect on the protected character (though some attacks may have an impact on the character’s surroundings or other nearby characters, especially those from weapons with the Blast Quality).\nEldar force ﬁelds tend to be very reliable, and \nrarely overload. If a force ﬁeld does overload, it ceases to function until its user repairs it. Most force ﬁelds require a Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use Test to repair.\nTable 4—5: Dark Eldar Armour and Fields\nName\n Locations Covered AP Wt\nLocations Covered AP Wt\n Availability\nXenohide Tunic\n Body\n 3\n 1 kg\n Plentiful\nXenohide Cloak\n All\n 2\n 3 kg\n Common\nKabalite Armour\n All\n 4\n 5 kg\n Average\nGhostplate Armour\n All\n 6\n 2 kg\n Rare\nWychsuit\n All\n 2\n 0.5 kg\n Common\nShadow Field\n –\n –\n 0.5 kg\n Near Unique\nClone Field\n –\n –\n 0.5 kg\n Near Unique"

A \nblade alone is naked without a choice poison, a pale shadow of the implement it should be.”\n–S’liassen Tael, Envenomer and Chymist\nWithin the blood-soaked arenas and throughout the deadly streets of the Dark City, chemical advantages are highly prized as a way of ensuring survival for \nanother day or another battle. Whether employing poisons against a rival, or dosing themselves with combat stimulants, \nDark Eldar will do whatever is necessary to seize victory.\nCOMBAT  DRUGS\nThough they drastically shorten the life expectancy of those \nwho take them, drugs and stimulants are in widespread use throughout Dark Eldar society. The fashions and the vagaries of supply and demand commonly inﬂuence which ones are used during a given battle or realspace raid, but certain drugs remain popular amongst the inhabitants of the Nexus of Shadows.\nDark Eldar combat drugs are designed to enhance Eldar \nphysiology, and do not function in the bodies of any other creature. Any non-Eldar who takes a dose of any of the combat drugs listed below must pass a Hard (–20) Toughness Test or \nbe immediately Stunned for 1d5 Rounds as the chemicals course \npainfully through a physiology they are not designed to augment. \nShould this Test result in four or more Degrees of Failure, the character also suffers 1d10 Damage, ignoring Armour and \nToughness Bonus, as he suffers a particularly adverse reaction. \nThese drugs are not designed to be used in combination, and \nan Eldar character attempting to take a second dose of any \ncombat drug while the ﬁrst is still in effect must also \ntake the Test listed above, regardless of whether it \nis a second dose of the same drug, or a dose of a new drug. Whether he passes or fails, the character only gains the beneﬁts of the most recent dose of drugs he has taken.\nAll the drugs listed below remain in effect for 50+2d10 \nminutes unless otherwise noted. Every dose taken inﬂicts physical and spiritual stress on a character, ageing him and more rapidly thinning his already-hollow soul. Each dose causes 1d5 Corruption Points upon consumption.\nACCELERAI\nThis stimulant alters the warrior’s adrenal glands, producing a substance that is far more potent. Harvested from the brain of a small, multi-legged, and extremely aggressive predator found on the ruined shell of the Light of Terra and certain \nspace hulks that drift through the Koronus Expanse, Accelerai \naccelerates the user’s attacks to a blistering tempo. For the \ndrug’s duration, the character may make an extra attack when \nperforming the Multiple Attacks Action. After the effect ends, the character gains a level of Fatigue and must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer a –5 penalty \nto his Initiative for 1d5 days as the stimulant’s harmful by-\nproducts ﬂush out of his system.\nCORPSE  OBMULEN\nFirst found growing amidst the corpses of fallen warriors during the taking of the Nexus of Shadows, Corpse Obmulen appears to be a cousin of the better-known Dusk Lotus and seems, against all odds, to have been on the Gaelan Sphere longer than the Dark Eldar. Since their arrival, however, the blood-drinking plant has ﬂourished, and covers many pits of discarded corpses with an ashen veil. Though inherently toxic, \nCorpse Obmulen is a popular additive to steroidal compounds \nthat saturates muscle ﬁbres and makes them superhumanly \nresistant to the stress and tension of use, allowing the warrior \nto exert himself to an extreme level for a protracted period of \ntime. The character gains a +20 to Strength for the duration of the drug’s effect. After the effect ends, the character gains a level of Fatigue and must make a Difﬁcult (–10) Strength Test or suffer 1d10 Strength Damage that lasts for a day or \nuntil he receives another dose of Corpse Obmulen.\nSHUDDERSTEP\nTailored from a number of incredibly dangerous ingredients, including grass harvested from speciﬁc Yu’Vath grave worlds and miniscule quantities of the stasis venom of the Ariadne Helspider, Shudderstep is designed to hyper-stimulate fast-twitch muscle ﬁbres. A dose of Shudderstep enables a warrior to run at incredible speeds. The character gains the Unnatural Speed Trait for the duration of the drug’s effect. After the effect \nends, the character gains a level of Fatigue and must make a \nChallenging (+0) Toughness Test or pass out for 1d10+5 minutes as the deferred exhaustion catches up to him.\nMURDER □S BOON\nDistilled from the cranial ﬂuid of slaves who have been poisoned with a combination of other drugs and toxins including Corpse Obmulen and Liquid Agony, Murder’s Boon ampliﬁes a warrior’s killer instincts. The warrior gains the Proven (4) Quality on all melee attacks for the duration \nTable 4—6: Drugs and Poisons\nName\n Wt Availability\nAccelerai\n 0.1 kg Scarce\nCorpse Obmulen 0.1 kg Rare\nEviscerine\n 0.1 kg Scarce\nMurder’s Boon 0.1 kg Scarce\nShudderstep\n 0.1 kg Rare\nSoul Echo\n 0.1 kg Extremely Rare\nEssence of Perfect Vitriol 0.1 kg Scarce\nFinal Breath\n 0.1 kg Rare\nHeartﬁre\n 0.1 kg Very Rare\nLiquid Agony\n 0.1 kg Scarce\nNightmare Philtre 0.1 kg Very Rare\nSanguine Exodus 0.1 kg Rare\nVitae Rebellion 0.1 kg Extremely Rare"

After the effect ends, the character \ngains a level of Fatigue and must make a Challenging (+0) \nWillpower Test or lose himself in the suffering he has imbibed, suffering a –20 penalty to Fellowship, Intelligence, and Willpower for the next 1d5 hours.\nEVISCERINE\nEviscerine is a derivative of the rare but seemingly uninteresting viperleaf found on certain worlds within the Koronus Expanse. Though The Sutured Helix does not share exactly how it transforms this barbed vine into a drug as effective as Eviscerine, the raw material nonetheless \ncommands a high price on the Nexus of Shadows. Cold \nTrader groups such as the Consorvana Ring exchange vast quantities of viperleaf for xenos artefacts, and know better \nthan to ask why the devious aliens want this particular plant. \nOnce reﬁned into a useable drug, Eviscerine is a favourite \nof warriors who prefer to kill at close range. Heightening \nthe adrenaline sensitivity of perception centres of the brain and the conductivity of synapses and nerve ﬁbres, a dose of Eviscerine makes a warrior more able to perceive and avoid the attacks and defences of his enemies. The character gains +20 Weapon Skill for the duration of the drug’s effect. After the effect ends, the character gains a level of Fatigue and must make a Difﬁcult (–10) Toughness Test or lose \nhis Reaction in combat for 1d10 hours or until he receives another dose of Eviscerine.\nSOUL ECHO\nThe coalesced essence of a being who has been tortured not only unto death but far beyond it, Soul Echo is almost pure pain, containing the last tormented gasp of a spirit bound in eternal agony. On the Nexus of Shadows, the only producer of Soul Echo is Drecarus himself, and his exact arcane processes are a jealously guarded secret. The character using this drug immediately gains 1d10 Pain Tokens and an additional 1d10 Corruption Points on top of the usual Corruption for using combat drugs. A character may not beneﬁt from another dose of Soul Echo for at least an hour after taking a dose, even if \nhe uses De-Tox or another similar ability to clear his system \nof drugs, and suffers the negative effects listed above if he attempts to use more Soul Echo anyway.\nTHE TOXIC SPE CTRUM\nThe Dark Eldar are experts in the many applications of poisons and toxins. Entire districts of Commorragh are given over to the manufacture of substances that can kill in countless thousands of different ways, and many an aristocrat’s court contains a master poisoner whose gifts can transform the merely agonising into the unrelentingly lethal. Many weapons employed by the Dark Eldar exude, are impregnated with, or otherwise employ potent hypertoxins, and most warriors have their own favourite cocktail of poisons. The toxic spectrum is something that all Dark Eldar appreciate with an artist’s \ninsight, and personal aesthetics are as important as effect \nwhen it comes to poisoning a rival, enemy or prey-beast.\nThe following section provides a number of common \npoisons employed by the Dark Eldar. Any of these poisons may be employed as alternative ammunition on any weapon \nwith the Toxic Quality, replacing the effects of the Toxic \nQuality temporarily. Alternatively, they may be employed using whatever other poison delivery methods a character can think of—the Dark Eldar are nothing if not creative in their application of toxins.\nESSENCE  OF PERFECT  VITRIOL\nPerfect Vitriol is the universal solvent, a corrosive agent capable of dissolving absolutely everything. Created by the Stryxis for reasons they refuse to explain and traded to the denizens of the Nexus of Shadows for use in their arenas and shadowy plots, no substance is proof against this liquid’s fury, and it must be stored in magnetic suspension because no material container exists that can hold it. Not to be stymied in their quest to weaponise everything in their grasp, the Dark Eldar of the Nexus of Shadows cleverly use ﬁelds and other exotic distribution systems to imbue their blades and projectiles with the vapours produced by this substance without degrading \ntheir own equipment too quickly for it to be of use.\nA failed Toughness Test to resist Essence of Perfect Vitriol \ninﬂicts 1d10 Strength Damage, with a bonus of +1 Damage \nfor each Degree of Failure on the Toughness Test.\nFINAL  BREATH\nA targeted paralytic agent that is derived from a plant native to Burnscour and brought to the Nexus of Shadows accidentally along with several beasts for the pits, Final Breath causes rapid respiratory shutdown, swiftly making it impossible for the target to breathe. The Dark Eldar ﬁrst discovered the effect of the plant when a number of slaves tasked with cleaning the pen of a Clawed Fiend were discovered dying after inhaling its deadly pollen. The Dark Eldar of the Nexus of Shadows were most impressed by the agonising death that this humble plant had \nYOU ARE ALREADY  DEAD…\nThe Dark Eldar love to draw out the kill, and their master poisoners often brew their ﬁnest toxins to this end. After all, why should a prey-beast have the right to die before the Dark Eldar allow its suffering to end? Many Dark Eldar also like to taunt their prey for longer than the poisons might normally allow. Timing is everything in a perfect kill, and it is considered a master’s mark to be able to deliver a ﬁnal, cutting insult that exactly ﬁlls a victim’s last seconds before a poison wreaks its terrible work.\nAny Dark Eldar poison of Good Craftsmanship \nmay be concocted to have a delayed effect if the buyer \nso chooses. Toxins with a delayed effect behave as \nnormal, but they do not cause their Damage and \nother deleterious effects until one Round after the \ntarget fails its Toughness Test.\nBest Craftsmanship toxins are the same, except the \nmaker can delay the effect for any amount of time up \nto 24 hours (chosen upon creation or acquisition of the poison) after the target fails its Toughness Test."

Unless the target is \naware of the poison in advance and knows to take a deep breath before its effects kick in, he counts his Toughness Bonus as half (rounding up) its normal value for determining how long he may hold his breath. The toxin remains in effect for 1d10+15 minutes or until the victim is treated, such as with De-Tox (see page 141 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook).\nHEARTFIRE\nHeartﬁre is a substance produced by the razor-spined fungi that inhabit certain parts of the Gaelan Sphere, and is found in the greatest concentrations in those specimens that have made their home in the shafts that house the coolant for many of the sphere’s mysterious processes. Apparently a defence mechanism against predators, this poison coats the spines and self-replicates within a victim’s body, polluting his blood with a kinetically unstable chemical that may ignite at any moment. Vigourous motion is often sufﬁcient to set the poisoned blood off, consuming the victim with a ﬁre within his own veins and arteries, burning up the oxygen in his blood.\nA failed Toughness Test to resist Heartﬁre has a lingering \neffect. Without extensive medical treatment, such as dialysis or some other means of cleansing or replacing the blood, the character is subject to this effect until death. Every time the character takes Impact or Explosive Damage, and every time the character runs, falls or is knocked prone, he must pass a Difﬁcult (–10) Toughness Test or immediately suffers \n1d10 Energy Damage that is not reduced by Armour or Toughness Bonus to the body (the ﬁre is concentrated in the chest, near the heart and lungs).\nLIQUID  AGONY\nPopular amongst nobles of the Kabal of the Splintered Talon involved in realspace raids against particularly valuable targets and those ﬁghting rivals at home alike, Liquid Agony is a potent neurotoxin that ampliﬁes nerve conductivity to extreme levels, turning even the weight of clothing and the caress of the air into torturous sensations. Liquid Agony is based upon the viscous bodily ﬂuids of the Sandsnapper of Vaporious, a rare, segmented \nserpent that inhabits the deep deserts. Some within the depths of \nthe Nexus of Shadows imbibe tiny quantities of Liquid Agony to heighten the impact of sensations, but overdoses are all too common and leave the wretched beings in a state of perpetual agony just long enough for a hungry soul to ﬁnd the source of the screams and drink deep of the self-inﬂicted pain.\nA failed Toughness Test to resist Liquid Agony causes \nthe target to be Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to his own Perception Bonus. Liquid Agony has no effect on \ntargets that are already Stunned.NIGHTMARE  PHILTRE\nThis toxin creates terror in its victims, nothing more or less. Though the exact composition of this poison is a jealously guarded secret of The Sutured Helix, dark whispers tell of how Salaine Morn commissioned Drecarus to create it shortly after her forces slew a Rak’Gol raiding party that had simultaneously attacked the human settlement she was in the midst of pillaging. It is said that she brought one of the creatures’ corpses back to the Haemonculus as a gift to entice his services, and he repaid her with this serum of hell-dreams some days later. By chemically inﬂuencing the “ﬁght or ﬂight” reaction, and then triggering it, an overwhelming sense \nof panic and dread afﬂicts the victim, without obvious cause or \nreason—something that is arguably more terrifying than being \nafraid of anything speciﬁc. In many cases, the horriﬁed psyche \nactually tries to invent some fearful apparition to justify the terror, a feat of self-delusion that only serves to act as a beautiful \naccompaniment to the Dark Eldar feeding upon this unreasoning \npanic. Hard-won experience has taught the Dark Eldar that this particular poison does not have an effect on all of their foes—even the most concentrated dose does not inﬂuence a Space Marine in any way, and it seems to merely enrage Orks.\nA failed Toughness Test to resist Nightmare Philtre is \ntreated as a failed Fear Test with the same number of Degrees of Failure. As a result, the target must immediately roll on Table 10–4: The Shock Table on page 294 of the R\nOGUE \nTRADER  Core Rulebook. Creatures immune to Fear or that \nfollow different rules for Fear are unaffected by this poison. Additionally, when an Ork is affected by a Nightmare Philtre, the drug always triggers the “ﬁght” side of the reaction, causing the victim to automatically enter a Frenzy upon a failed Toughness Test instead of having its usual effect (see page 98 of the R\nOGUE TRADER  Core Rulebook).\nSANGUINE  EXODUS\nThis toxin causes the victim to begin exsanguinating rapidly, his blood pouring from every wound as if seeking to escape from his body. Sanguine Exodus in part on the saliva of the Culamia Bloodsucker that is all too common on the world of Burnscour and certain other Death Worlds in the Koronus Expanse, and has become popular amongst the Wyches of the Withered Blade Cult, as it allows them to kill with even \ngreater elegance and conservation of motion.\nA failed Toughness Test to resist Sanguine Exodus causes \nthe target to immediately suffer from Blood Loss.\nVITAE REBELLION\nA cruel and savage toxin, Vitae Rebellion is a genetic \nserum of incredible potency created in the laboratories of The Sutured Helix and sold to Dark Eldar nobles on the Nexus of Shadows who desire a certain explosive ﬂair to their kills. Vitae Rebellion aggressively transforms the biochemistry of its victims, transmogrifying critical ﬂuids into chemicals and compounds that react violently with one another. The end result is gruesome and spectacular, as \nthe victim detonates in a shower of mutated gore.\nA failed Toughness Test to resist Vitae Rebellion causes the \ntarget to suffer 2d10 Explosive Damage that ignores Armour \nbut is reduced by the target’s Toughness Bonus as normal."

What is known about Drecarus is that he is an incalculably ancient \nbeing, and that as long as anyone can remember he has been \nsole master of his coven, the Sutured Helix. Though his coven \nonce held a position of some prominence in the twisted dens of Commorragh, Drecarus grew weary of the bickering of Archons and even fellow Haemonculi, and so he lead his coven \ninto the webway that they might focus on their twisted work. \nDuring its aeons of sojourning, The Sutured Helix ran \nafoul of a group of Rak’Gol marauders while travelling the \nKoronus Expanse. Their damaged vessel was saved by the raiding ﬂeet of Zaergarn Kul. Eager to have a Haemonculi Coven on the Nexus of Shadows, Zaergarn offered the crippled vessel an offer it could not refuse, and Drecarus grudgingly assented to become Zaergarn’s ally and advisor. Over time, Zaergarn trusted Drecarus with more and more of his rule, and the Haemonculus’ power over the Nexus of Shadows grew. Drecarus worked to accelerate the war between the two Archons, and it was he who provided \nSalaine Morn with the means to acquire the Mandrake who \nslew Zaergarn. When the dust settled, the Haemonculus was victorious. With Salaine banished and Zaergarn’s spirit \ntrapped inside The Soul Reaver, Drecarus is now master of the \nNexus of Shadows, and rules through subtle manipulation \nof Zaergarn’s Kabal of the Splintered Talon, which does not even yet suspect its true lord’s death.\nMovement: 4/8/12/24   Wounds: 24\nArmour: Gnarlskin (2 All).

For years, since his demise at the hands of a Mandrake sent by Salaine Morn during their power struggle, his soul has been trapped within the twisted heart of The  Soul Reaver. While The  Soul Reaver draws power \nfrom all of those who die within the Nexus of Shadows, \nZaergarn’s assassin attacked him while he was observing the \nvessel’s tormented heart, bathing in the pain that exuded \nfrom it.

When the Explorers sever The Soul Reaver from the Nexus \nof Shadows, however, Zaergarn’s echo is able to guide The  \nSoul Reaver down the path of vengeance against Salaine, his killer, and Drecarus, his treacherous ally who stole his Kabal instead of retrieving his soul and resurrecting him.

Trueborn are raised to regard those around them with contempt and derision, viewing themselves as superior. To their credit, this is often the case, with the long and ruthless upbringing of a Trueborn child creating a killer with prowess equal to its arrogance and ambition.\nAmongst the Splintered Talon Kabal, rapid-ﬁring \nshardcarbines and long, serrated blades of exquisite quality are some of the most fashionable weapons. Beyond the easy reach \nof many half-born warriors, these deadly implements form \nthe common armament of many Trueborn within the Kabal. \nHowever, the wealth and power of even the least inﬂuential of Trueborn is sufﬁcient for them to enter battle with deadlier and more exotic weaponry more often, and many choose to \ncarry splinter cannons, shredders, blasters, and dark lances \nwith which to obliterate their prey.\nMovement: 5/10/15/30   Wounds: 12\nArmour: Kabalite armour (All 4).

Whether slaughtering whimpering lesser races during a realspace raid or eviscerating their rivals in a death-race high above the streets, Reavers find joy only by turning their skill as pilots to murderous ends.\nSeveral small Reaver sects gather to the arena of the \nWithered Blade. Their deadly sport takes place high above the stands amidst razor-sharp obstacles, often simultaneously with the gladiatorial bouts far below. More than a few clashes on the gore-caked sands of the arena ﬂoor have been enlivened by a splatter of blood and a shower of body parts and jetbike pieces plummeting from above. Sometimes the Reavers who ﬂy above the Shadowspine \nPits descend to slaughter combatants or even members of the audience in murderous ﬂybys, much to the amusement of those spectators who they have not just eviscerated.\nMovement: 6/12/18/36   Wounds: 9\nArmour: Wychsuit (All 2).

Each has been subjected to agonising augmentative and transformative surgeries, grafting great wings to their shoulders, augmenting their ﬂesh with synth-muscle and adrenaline dispensers, and hollowing their bones so that each Scourge can truly ﬂy. Even after these gruelling procedures, a Scourge’s ascension is incomplete, for the newly transformed Dark Eldar must \nsoar to the eyries of their new kin upon blood-soaked \nwings still raw from their implantation, surviving the perils \nof Hellion gangs and the high-speed hunts of Reavers and Razorwings. Only once this vertical pilgrimage is complete can they truly be called Scourges.\nScourges serve as messengers for the powerful, carrying \nvenom-sealed missives. The recipient has the only means to cure the courier and open the message. This role gives the Scourges great freedom and power, for to slay a Scourge while he performs his duties is punishable by the most creative and painful of deaths. In battle, Scourges favour long-ranged weaponry, unwilling to risk their fragile augmented bodies to the fury of melee, and a ﬂight of Scourges can deliver that ﬁrepower to the enemy swiftly and from unexpected angles. The patronage of powerful Archons and Succubi allows a Scourge to afford some of the deadliest and most exotic weaponry, from toxic shardcarbines, to vicious shredders, deadly blasters, and even haywire blasters and heat lances.\nMovement (Walking: 5/10/15/30  Wounds: 10\nMovement (Flying): 12/24/36/72\nArmour: Ghostplate (All 6, PR 20).

WRACK\nDrecarus and his coven have countless thousands of assistants, collectively known as Wracks. These degraded, twisted beings no longer resemble the Dark Eldar they once were, but rather the abominations they have chosen to become, resorting to gruesome transformative surgeries in order to stave off the ennui that comes from centuries of debauched experience.\nWracks one day hope to ascend to the ranks of the \nHaemonculi themselves, though whether or not any amongst them has ever done so is unknown. The Haemonculi, careful with their secrets and essentially immortal, have little room \nfor rivals, only servants, slaves, and subjects. Each Wrack is, \nhowever, a capable torturer, alchemist, and physician in its \nown right, for few Haemonculi are inclined to the indignities of manual labour and instead command their minions to perform the procedures they direct. Some Wracks take the \nbizarre, specialised results of their masters’ dark science onto \nthe battleﬁeld, and equip themselves with liquiﬁer guns, hexriﬂes, and even stranger contraptions that bring death and pain to their enemies.\nMovement: 4/8/12/24   Wounds: 19\nArmour: Gnarlskin (All 2).

Those who are weak of mind or body are swiftly traded away to Kabals or Haemonculi covens, for the Withered Blade seeks those with strength and a spark of fury \nto better serve their needs. As a result, most of those who ﬁnd \nthemselves in the Withered Blade’s dungeons are ﬁghters, and already bear the scars of las-burn, bullet, and blade.

Over the following years, Agnelain saw his brethren mutilated and ﬂensed down to little more than augmetic-enhanced \nskeletons driven by shattered minds, yet Agnelain alone was \nspared the worst of the torturers’ cruel attentions. He did \nnot ﬁnd out why until decades later—the Dark Eldar had \ndiscovered that he was the leader amongst the surviving Tech-Priests, if only by dint of his rank, and had spent years siphoning and pillaging lore from the minds of his subordinates before they reached the leader.After nearly forty years with a dwindling number of fellow \ncaptives for company, Agnelain’s mind had turned in on itself, focussing on the knowledge he had attained rather than face \nthe horrors of his surroundings, until eventually his captors \ncame for him as well. It took the Dark Eldar a matter of years to unlock the secrets of his mind and begin sifting through them to ﬁnd anything of use.

While the raids eventually ceased due to the Imperial Fists’ counter-assaults, several Battle-Brothers were taken \ncaptive. Ludvos Tarn is the only survivor of those brought \nback to the Nexus of Shadows.Long ago stripped of his war gear, Tarn still holds true \nto the Emperor and is a ﬁgure of awe and devotion for the human captives imprisoned alongside him, both because he is a member of the Adeptus Astartes and because he is one of the few enduring ﬁgures of leadership they have. Tarn’s history amongst the Dark Eldar is well-known amongst the humans, though perhaps somewhat exaggerated—it is claimed that he was given as a gift of patronage to Drecarus, so that the Haemonculus could break the warrior’s iron will and unmake his superhuman ﬂesh. Drecarus, to his ire, was unable to achieve either, for the fortitude of the Imperial Fist was too great for even the Arch-Agonist to overcome, and out of spite he was given to the Withered Blade to die within their arenas.\nClearly, Tarn did not die, though when questioned about \nhis past, his response is typically a grim smile and three simple words: “The Emperor Protects.” Testing the limits \nof his Chapter’s vaunted resistance to pain and despair has \noccupied the Cult of the Withered Blade for years, and their \nbest efforts have not yet revealed any results besides the \nbroken corpses of his foes.

When she attempted to gain passage to the Koronus Expanse, her vessel was attacked by Dark Eldar Raiders.\nThe Kabal that claimed her fell to the machinations of another \nwithin a week of her arrival in the Dark City, and she has since \nbeen within the ownership of several other Kabals and cults \nwithin Dark Eldar society, each one crumbling due to completely unrelated events, as if misfortune is attracted to this young woman.

This section includes a list of some—but hardly all—of the terrible creatures the Explorers might face on the sands of the arena.CHRONO -GLADIATOR\nIt was a glorious day for the Cult of the Withered Blade when they ﬁrst learned of the concept of chrono-gladiators from the chatter of slaves. The human whose idle words had brought it to their attention was subsequently rewarded by being transformed into the ﬁrst of many such creatures produced for the cult. A chrono-gladiator is a warrior living on borrowed time—each one is ﬁtted with devices that will slay him when his own personal clock reaches zero. The only way to increase the time remaining is to kill.\nThe Cult of the Withered Blade has ordered the creation \nof countless of chrono-gladiators by captured Tech-Priests. Each is subjected to horriﬁc torments and forcibly addicted to a unique cocktail of combat stimulants and pain suppressants. Injectors within their bodies provide the chemicals with every \nlife they take, but the doses provide only brief respite. The \nquantities within each gland are small, and the withdrawal \nsymptoms are lethal, resulting in agonising pain as their bodily ﬂuids react violently, and then explosively, with one another. To ensure that the deaths of chrono-gladiators are not wasted, they are held in stasis between battles.\nMovement: 5/10/15/30   Wounds: 16\nArmour: Implanted plates (All 3).

Upon killing a creature, the chrono-gladiator gains an additional level of Unnatural Strength and becomes immune to Fatigue and all Critical Effects that do not cause death or the loss of body parts for 1d5 Rounds. Any further kills made within this time add 1d5 Rounds to the end \nof the current duration. Should a chrono-gladiator not gain a \ndose of the drugs within 5 Rounds of the beneﬁts ceasing—either through inability to kill, or through a lack of drugs remaining—it immediately suffers a level of Fatigue and 1d5 Explosive Damage to the Body, ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus. This Damage and Fatigue repeats every 5 Rounds until the chronogladiator receives another dose of the drugs.Weapons: Multiple sets of implanted talons (Melee; 1d10+8 R; Pen 3; Razor-Sharp, Toxic).Gear: Implanted stimm-inductor with 2d10 doses remaining.\nChrono-gladiator\nWS BS S T Ag I nt Per WP Fel\n(6) (6)\n48 23 38 32 54 26 31 36 22\nRelhadhar Antariel\nWS BS S T Ag I nt Per WP Fel\n(12)\n54 33 41 38 62 35 45 47 31"

Countless trillions of species of spiders and similar organisms exist on innumerable worlds and parts beyond, and the webway is no exception. Native to the ragged and twisted webway tunnels that stretch across and beyond the Calixis Sector, the Koronus Expanse, and the Screaming Vortex between, the Ariadne Helspider is a vicious, many-\nlegged creature that seems unfettered by the normal passage \nof time. Its wounds heal as if its ﬂesh was reverting to a past \nstate, its attacks seem to strike home even though the creature \nremains some metres distant, and blows struck against it seem impossibly to miss, as if they had never happened.\nHunted for sport by the Dark Eldar of the Nexus of \nShadows, Helspiders are a local favourite of the Beastmasters of the Shadowspine Pits. The audience also enjoys the unique confusion and suffering these creatures can inﬂict. Further, these beasts also make their pit matches more exciting by their habit of manipulating the web of fate to slip past the normally impenetrable ﬁelds that keep the combatants in the ring. It is not unheard of for these creatures to run rampant through the stands until being brought under control, to the delight of any Dark Eldar not in their path.\nMovement: 16/32/48/96   Wounds: 9\nArmour: Chitinous carapace (All 3).

Each turn, an Ariadne Helspider may re-roll a single missed attack roll or Dodge Test. Those who encounter a Helspider in battle ﬁnd themselves becoming confused by conﬂicting memories as time alters around them, and at the end of any combat involving Ariadne Helspiders, a character must pass an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or a Difﬁcult (–10) \nIntelligence Test. Any sentient creature that fails this Test gains 1 Insanity Point, plus one additional Insanity Point per Degree of Failure.Weapons: Time-rending mandibles† (Melee; 10m; 1d10+4 R; Stasis Venom††), webbing (Basic; 20m; S/–/–; Snare).\n†Time-Rending Mandibles: Thanks to the anachronistic \nquirks of its physiology, the Ariadne Helspider’s grasp \nsometimes exceeds its reach. It can make melee attacks against \nfoes up to 10 metres away as if it was adjacent to them. Due \nto the paradoxical nature of these strikes, attempts to Dodge or Parry them suffer a –10 penalty.††Stasis Venom: This potent and unusual venom works by holding a victim within a singular moment of existence until their metabolism overcomes it. The Haemonculi of the Sutured Helix prize the creature’s venom, as it preserves its victims perfectly. A creature wounded by an Ariadne Helspider’s mandibles must pass a Toughness Test with a –5 penalty for each wound inﬂicted by the attack. Failure causes the creature to be Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to 1d5+2 minus the victim’s Toughness Bonus, to a minimum of 1. While Stunned by stasis venom, a creature cannot be harmed in any way by any source—the creature is frozen in time.\nFleshwrought Drake\nWS BS S T Ag I nt Per WP Fel\n(12) (15)\n42 15 65 58 31 18 42 31 01\nAriadne Helspider\nWS BS S T Ag I nt Per WP Fel\n(15)\n39 33 49 38 51 12 45 31 01"

A Clawed Fiend is a mound of corded muscle, covered by durable grey fur. Every one of its extremities is lethal, from its shredding talons, to its bone-bladed tail, to its great, red head set, with slavering jaws and far too many beady eyes. Perhaps even more startling than the creature’s physique is the savagery with which it pursues prey. Terrors in their own right, Clawed Fiends hardly need to feel the indelicate touch of a Beastmaster’s \nlash to be hunters of the highest calibre. When harmed, \nhowever, this beast enters a slashing madness, converting its assailants into a gruesome red slurry as it tears and bellows at everything and anything around it.\nThe Dark Eldar delight in such violence, of course, and so \nClawed Fiends are prized by many Beastmasters, including those of the Cult of the Withered Blade, both as creatures to ﬁght in the Shadowspine Pits and as extra muscle for the realspace raids that drag new fodder back to the arenas.

Despite the difﬁculty of keeping these creatures in the materium, to say nothing of keeping them under control once there, Khymerae \nresonate with the sadistic psyche of the Dark Eldar in a way \nthat natural beasts cannot, and Beastmasters are often \nfound trailing packs of these hulking, ethereal beasts, \ndriving them ever onward to greater and greater \nheights of slaughter.In the pits of the Nexus of Shadows, there are few sights \nmore outwardly unnatural and horrifying than a pack of \nKhymerae phase-shifting through a solid wall to rend the \nﬂesh of a group of slaves with their claws and lashing tendrils \nof knotted ﬂesh. These wretches serve as fodder for the warp-spawned Khymerae, and the Dark Eldar drink deep of their terror.

The large avians do not at ﬁrst appear to be a threat to a seasoned traveller—and it is this fact that makes them so very deadly. Razorwings are blisteringly fast and agile, capable of outmanoeuvring a ﬂying Hellion ganger on his skyboard, and their hardened talons, beaks, and razor-tipped feathers can strip a body of \narmour and ﬂesh in an instant. It is not unknown for ﬂocks \nof Razorwings to reduce their prey to a mess of bones and \nblood in a single pass before carrying off the skeleton of \ntheir victim to devour elsewhere.\nAnyalra always takes a particular interest when her \nBeastmasters unleash these graceful, feathered killers in the \narena.

Seldom are any of the secrets of the Adeptus Mechanicus of value to the Dark Eldar, for their eldritch technology is as sorcery to the sciences of the Martian priesthood. However, it is not lore that the thought-pillagers and meme-scalpels seek, but concepts that bring new sights and sensations to the Nexus of Shadows.\nServitorisation is not a concept entirely unfamiliar to \nthe Dark Eldar—Grotesques are, after all, lobotomised \nslaves of a similar sort—but the notions of Murder-servitors \nand Arco-ﬂagellants found approval in the dark cliques of the Nexus when they were mined from Magos Domos’ brain. Autonomous killing machines designed to terrorise \nand slaughter appealed to the murderous decadence of the \nTalonlord’s court, and when these concepts were found in the Magos’ mental archives, Drecarus’ Haemonculi almost immediately began work to create something similar. Wrought from the ﬂesh of Dark Eldar who were deserving of some cruel and unusual punishment, Murderﬁend Servitors are vicious, swift, and entirely remorseless creatures, seeking only the deaths of those around them and to slake the unholy thirst that still burns their hollow souls.\nMovement: 6/12/18/36   Wounds: 12\nArmour: Mechanical form (All 4).

Dismissive of the graceful aesthetics of Craftworlder starship design, Dark Eldar starships are exercises in excess, with every vessel a canvas upon which shipwright, Archon, and Haemonculus alike have unleashed the vilest fruits of their imagination. For a ship to bear deck after deck of torture chambers is common, to better sustain the unnatural hunger of the crew on their voyages, but many vessels also include far more imaginative spectacles of brutality. \nAs such, the vessels of the Dark Eldar, while bearing \nmany superﬁcial similarities to one another, are all unique creations, outﬁtted to the particular desires of their creators and commanders. Classifying such ships is difﬁcult, and though many long and dusty treatises exist to exhaustively classify these differing conﬁgurations in Imperial Navy archives, each new contact with the Dark Eldar invariably renders some of these theories invalid.\nWhilst such pedantry may be entirely ﬁtting within the \ncomfortable conﬁnes of Naval bases and Administratum facilities, the needs of front-line commanders are different, and Imperial Navy captains and Rogue Traders alike have come to refer to these wildly differing vessels by two broad designations: the Torture-class cruiser, and the Corsair-class raider.\nDARK ELDAR  SPECIAL  RULES\nAll Dark Eldar ships are subject to the special rules detailed below. Note that, while similarities in design do exist between the vessels of the Dark Eldar and those of their Craftworld cousins, the Dark Eldar do not use or beneﬁt from the special rules for Eldar vessels in other R\nOGUE TRADER  books such \nas LURE OF THE EXPANSE  and BATTLEFLEET  KORONUS  unless \nnoted. Any rules that these disparate factions have in common are listed here in full.\nMaster Starfarers: Like their Craftworld kin, the Dark \nEldar are some of the most accomplished starfarers in the galaxy, and their ships are designed to make the best use of their talents. Any Dark Eldar aboard a Dark Eldar vessel may re-roll any Piloting Tests for Manoeuvre Actions.\nSlave-takers: The warriors who serve aboard Dark Eldar \nvessels are vicious, cruel, and bloodthirsty beings, and are made deadlier by the agony of their prey. They will often drag away scores of crew during their raids and boarding actions. During Boarding Actions, Dark Eldar vessels add +10 to any Command Tests, and inﬂict 1d5+2 Crew Population and \nMurderﬁend Servitor\nWS BS S T Ag I nt Per WP Fel\n(6) (6) (12)\n55 06 38 39 64 16 41 12 04"

      "text": "136\nIV: The Treacherous Path\nIV: The Treacherous Path\nIV: The Treacherous Path\n1d5+2 Morale Damage. During Hit and Run Attacks, Dark \nEldar vessels add +20 to Command Tests and may choose to inﬂict 1d10 Crew Population and 1d10 Morale Damage instead of dealing a Critical Hit as they round up enemy crew and drag them away. A Dark Eldar vessel regains lost Crew Population and Morale equal to the amount of Damage that it inﬂicts to Crew Population and Morale during any Boarding Action or Hit and Run Attack, as the agony of the victims and slaves restores and invigorates the Dark Eldar crew.\nSharks of the Void: Dark Eldar vessels are impelled \nby all manner of exotic technologies, ranging from rows of aethersails that capture the spectral winds of the webway, to plasma drives that burn with the chained fury of enslaved stars, to gravitic impulse engines that bend the potent energies of a captured black hole to the crew’s will. In all cases, Dark Eldar vessels are swift and agile, able to easily outpace and outmanoeuvre their prey. Dark Eldar ships gain a +20 bonus on the Flank Speed Extended Action (or, if using the NPC Starship Actions rules in B\nATTLEFLEET  KORONUS , roll an \nadditional 1d5 and discard the lowest when determining additional Speed), and do not have to move at least half their speed before turning. All Dark Eldar vessels, regardless of type or class, may turn up to 90 degrees.\nShadowﬁelds: Rather than the brutish void shields \nemployed by humans, the Dark Eldar wreath their vessels in an inky blackness that makes them almost invisible against the cold, dark void. These ﬁelds confound even the electromantic scrying of starship augurs, concealing the vessel’s heat and emissions from prying eyes. All attacks against a vessel with a functioning shadowﬁeld suffer a –40 penalty on any Test to hit the vessel in addition to other penalties. Macrobatteries, which operate by ﬁlling the void with ordinance, suffer only a –20 penalty to hit. Ships also suffer a –30 to any attempts to use any Extended Actions against a ship protected by shadowﬁelds that involve Detection (such as Lock On or Focussed Augury). Finally, a vessel with shadowﬁelds may travel at full speed and adds +10 on all Manoeuvre Tests made while on Silent Running.\nMimic Engines: Many Dark Eldar ships are equipped \nwith strange devices that can be used to project false emissions during their approach, tricking their enemies into thinking that an ally approaches, not an enemy. Each Dark Eldar vessel employing mimic engines must be operating on Silent Running (to better hide behind the falsehood they are projecting), and may nominate a single class of vessel to appear as. This class of vessel must be of similar size to the Dark Eldar vessel—Raiders may appear as transports, raiders or frigates, while cruisers can appear as light cruisers, cruisers, battlecruisers, or grand cruisers. Vessels may attempt a Challenging (+0) Scrutiny+Detection Test to spot the \ninconsistencies in the illusion and detect the Dark Eldar vessel behind it, though crews which have encountered Dark Eldar before gain a +20 on this Test as they know the \nsubtle telltale signs of a mimic engine. \nArrogance and Spite: Dark Eldar vessels have no void \nshields and always have their shadowﬁelds active unless \nthese systems have been disabled or destroyed.DARK ELDAR  W EAPONRY\nThe following rules apply to certain Dark Eldar weapons, reﬂecting their exotic and alien nature:\nDisintegrator Macrocannons: Unlike the solid shells \nand unreﬁned lasers of human vessels, Dark Eldar employ weapons similar to their vehicle-mounted disintegrator cannons, sophisticated devices that unleash salvoes of unstable matter torn from the hearts of stolen suns. Equipped with advanced targeting systems, all attacks made with disintegrator macrocannons add a +10 to Ballistic Skill Tests.\nPhantom Lance: These weapons harness the unstable \nenergy known as Darklight, said to be drawn from massive celestial phenomena, to annihilate their foes. Even the tiniest quantity of Darklight reacts explosively with matter, and phantom lances channel colossal streams of the stuff, tightly controlled within constrictor ﬁelds to inﬂict catastrophic damage. A phantom lance deals an additional +1d10 Damage per Degree of Success, up to a maximum of +2d10 damage.\nAttack Craft: Dark Eldar vessels with launch bays are \nloaded with their own unique and deadly craft. If you are using the launch bay rules from B\nATTLEFLEET  KORONUS , the \nfollowing rules apply to Dark Eldar attack craft. Raptor interceptors have a Craft Rating of +15, a Speed of 12 VUs and a Squadron Size of 12. Tormentor Bombers have a Craft Rating of +6, a Speed of 9 VUs, and a Squadron Size of 6. Slavebringer Assault Boats have a Crew Rating of +11, a Speed of 12 VUs, and a Squadron Size of 5. None of these craft suffer a penalty for being below half-strength, and negate any Turret Rating bonuses that the target ship would normally receive when attempting to shoot them down in an incoming attack craft wave.\nTorpedoes: If you are using the torpedo rules from \nB\nATTLEFLEET  KORONUS , the following rules apply to Dark \nEldar torpedoes: All Dark Eldar torpedoes use the rules for Seeking Torpedoes, and negate any Turret Rating bonuses that the target ship would normally get when attempting to shoot down an incoming salvo. Dark Eldar torpedoes come in two varieties: void torpedoes and leech torpedoes. Void torpedoes employ a pulse of Darklight contained within a bubble of force to blast smoking hemispheres of matter from enemy vessels. They deal 2d10+14 Damage and may re-roll any Damage dice that roll a 3 or less. Leech torpedoes deal no Damage, and instead latch on to armour and sap a vessel’s power, imposing a –2 penalty to the ship’s Speed characteristic and a –30 penalty on all actions that increase speed. This penalty is not cumulative, but so long as even one leech torpedo remains attached, the penalty applies. The Emergency Repairs Extended Action immediately removes 1 leech torpedo, +1 additional attached leech torpedo per two Degrees of Success, instead of repairing any damaged components."

In the largest raids, a single squadron of Corsairs with mimic engines are often used to slip in amongst the prey while the rest of the ﬂeet coasts silently through the darkness of space.

Unlike the ﬁghting vehicles of other species, and even unlike the swift grav-tanks of their Craftworld cousins, Dark Eldar do not enter battle within the armoured shells of tanks and gunships, but rather hanging from the ﬂanks of swift and many-bladed skiffs, ready to descend at \na moment’s notice into the fury of battle.\nType: Skimmer \nTactical Speed: 35m \nCruising Speed: 350 kph Manoeuvrability: +25Structural Integrity: 20 Size: EnormousArmour: Front 18, Side 15, Rear 15 Crew: Pilot, GunnerCarrying Capacity: 10 warriors with gear.\nNPC P ILOTS\nThe Reaver Pilot proﬁle listed on page 123 serves as any vehicle crewman.

The vehicle’s size does not grant attackers any bonus to hit, nor does it impose any penalties upon the pilot’s attempts to Dodge. Further, no attacker may gain a bonus to hit from aiming at a vehicle with a ﬂickerﬁeld, as its inconsistent vanishing makes it \nimpossible to effectively train a weapon on it.\nPassenger-Operated Weaponry: Weapons noted as \npassenger-operated may only be ﬁred by characters travelling \nin the passenger section of the vehicle, using that passenger’s Ballistic Skill.\nPrecarious Mount: When an enemy makes a Fully Automatic \nAttack Action against a Venom, every third hit strikes one of the \npassengers instead of the vehicle itself. However, a passenger may disembark from a Venom as a Free Action by making a Challenging (+0) Acrobatics Test; if the passenger fails this Test, then a moment’s hesitation and an awkward landing increase the time taken to disembark to a Half Action.Availability: Very Rare\nREAVER  JETBIKE\nBeloved and customised by their owners, Reaver jetbikes are the ultimate blend of velocity and lethality. For a Reaver, it is not sufﬁcient to slay one’s foes, or to travel at breakneck speeds with effortless grace. Doing both, simultaneously, is a true test of a Reaver’s prowess, and everything about a Reaver jetbike is turned towards this end, from the stripped-down and reshaped chassis to \nimprove speed and aerodynamics, to the vicious blades that \nadorn them, streaked with the blood of countless victims.\nType: Skimmer \nTactical Speed: 50m\nCruising Speed: 400 kph Manoeuvrability: +30Structural Integrity: 8 Size: HulkingArmour: Front 15, Side 12, Rear 10 Crew: PilotCarrying Capacity: None.\nW eapons\nPilot-operated splinter riﬂe (Facing Front; 80m; S/3/5; 1d10+2 R; Pen 3; Clip 200; Rld 2 Full; Toxic).\nSpecial Rules\nSkimmer: See above.Bladevanes: A Reaver jetbike is a weapon in its own right, and in the hands of a skilled rider can be deadly indeed. When attempting a Ram Action against a creature, a Reaver jetbike deals 1d10+5 R Damage, Pen 4, increasing to 2d10+5 R Damage if travelling at least twice its tactical speed.

If the pilot chooses to take an additional –20 penalty \non the Drive (Skimmers) Test to perform this Ram Action, he may choose the location struck, as if the attack were a Called Shot. Note that this means that a Reaver can potentially strike down the passengers and crew of open-topped vehicles.\nExposed: Enemies may target the pilot of a Reaver jetbike \nwith a Called Shot Attack Action. In addition, when an enemy \nmakes a Fully Automatic Attack Action against a Reaver jetbike, \nevery third hit strikes the pilot instead of the vehicle itself. \nAvailability: Rare\nRAZORWING  JETFIGHTER  \nFlown by those few Reavers who have earned sufﬁcient wealth and prestige to escape the death-races, a Razorwing jetﬁghter is a deadly aircraft, designed to be a lethal predator against anything that moves upon the ground. Armed with a variety of weapons, the deadliest tools these ﬁghters possess are the bizarre missiles that produce exotic and lethal effects to their pilots’ twisted tastes.Type: Flyer  \nTactical Speed: 40m/20 AUsCruising Speed: 1,750 kph Manoeuvrability: +40\nStructural Integrity: 25 \nSize: EnormousArmour: Front 20, Side 20, Rear 20 Crew:  Pilot\nCarrying Capacity: None.\nW eapons\nPilot-operated twin-linked splinter riﬂes (Facing Front; 80m; S/3/5; 1d10+2 R; Pen 3; Clip 500; Rld 2 Full; Toxic, Twin-Linked) and two pilot-operated dark lances (Facing Front; Range 160m; S/–/–; 3d10+10 X; Pen 20; Clip 50; Rld 3 Full; Felling, Proven [4]) and four pilot-operated missiles chosen from the following list: monoscythe missiles, necrotoxin missiles, shatterﬁeld missiles.\nSpecial Rules\nFlyer: In Flyer mode, this vehicle uses aerodynamic principles \nto stay aloft. When airborne, it must move at least half of its cruising speed at all times, lest it crash into the ground. If it ever becomes completely immobilised due to damage, it will plummet to the ground and be destroyed upon impact.Mastery of Gravity: To Eldar of all kinds, gravity is something to be manipulated and turned to their ends by advanced technology. At any time, the Razorwing jetﬁghter may operate \nas a Skimmer (following all the rules for a Skimmer, noted \nabove) rather than a as Flyer.Linked Pilot-Operated Weaponry: Weapons classiﬁed as “pilot-operated” may all be ﬁred by the pilot, as one Standard Attack Action, at any number of targets within range and no more than one AU (roughly 100m) apart from one another. Roll \nAttack Rolls and Damage Rolls separately for each weapon.\nMonoscythe Missiles: These exotic devices detonate \nabove the ground with a pulse of force that extends \nin a ﬂat plane parallel with the ground. This \npulse, inﬁnitely thin, can shear through ﬂesh \nand armour like the ﬁnest blade, leaving dismembered corpses behind. A monoscythe missile has the following proﬁle: Heavy; 250m; S/–/–; 3d10+5 R; Pen 4; \nClip 1; Rld –; Blast (8). A monoscythe missile cannot affect \nanything above or below the targets, and always hits the Body \nof all targets within the blast unless the attack roll succeeds by two or more Degrees of Success, in which case it hits the Head location of all targets within the blast.Necrotoxin Missiles: These missiles contain a large quantity of virulent poison. When the missile detonates, the casing shatters into thousands of toxin-coated razor shards. A necrotoxin missile has the following proﬁle: Heavy; 250m; S/–/–; 2d10 R; Pen 4; Clip 1; Rld –; Blast (8), Felling (1), Tearing, Toxic.Shatterﬁeld Missiles: These missiles contain two systems that work in sequence, detonating in a carefully timed manner for greatest effect. The ﬁrst blast rips all the heat from the surrounding area, leaving frozen statues in the place of any unfortunate enough to be in its radius. A split-second later, a shockwave of kinetic force \nerupts from the missile, shattering those statues. A shatterﬁeld \nmissile has the following proﬁle: Heavy; 250m; S/–/–; 3d10 I; Clip 1; Rld –; Blast (8). Any creature hit by a shatterﬁeld missile must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test before \nDamage is rolled; if it fails, then it is frozen solid, and is rendered immobile 1d5 Rounds. Targets that have been frozen are also more vulnerable to heavy impacts, and count their Toughness Bonus as 0 when hit by attacks that deal Impact Damage.Availability: Near Unique\nSkills"
