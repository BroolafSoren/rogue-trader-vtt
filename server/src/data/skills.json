Dodge can be used to avoid both melee and ranged attacks. When Dodging an area effect weapon (such as flamers), a successful Dodge moves the character to the edge of the area of effect, as long as it is no further away than the character’s Agility Bonus in metres.

This differs from many systems that employ codes or cogitators that are more suited to the Tech-Use Skill. Using this Skill without proper tools or equipment is extremely challenging, and any attempt to bypass a lock or other security system without using a multikey or other set of appropriate tools suffers from a –20 penalty.",

Both taming and training beasts are Extended Tests, the Duration of which is determined by the nature and temper of the creature involved. Once an animal has been broken to its master’s will or at least formed a partnership for particularly strong-willed beasts—directing it or issuing commands is a Half Action. Wild animals, or those trained for hostility and aggression, can have their Disposition changed by one level for every 2 Degrees of Success, up to a maximum of three levels by a Full Action use of this Skill. Wrangling is of no use against cyber-animals, psy-bonded animals, or against any creature with true sentience.",
