      "text": "FOREWORD\nTitle\n3\nThis project immediately intrigued me when Games Workshop approached Fantasy Flight Games to consider\nhandling this remarkable intellectual property. Although the book had a relatively modest concept initially,\nwe quickly realized that we were ready for a wonderful challenge. When Warhammer 40,000 was first\nconceived as a tabletop miniatures game stretching back to the 1980s, one of the working titles was \"Rogue Trader.\"\nAfter the parent brand, a tabletop miniatures game, \"Warhammer 40,000\" became the official title and\nquickly became an international gaming phenomenon. Each year, the release of the Warhammer 40,000 rules by\nGames Workshop inspires countless miniature battles that change the course of mankind's vision of the future.\n\nRogue Trader is quite literally a game about operating on the fringes of the Imperium, walking amongst\nalien and unknown worlds beyond the Emperor's light, with none to rely on but yourself. Fail, and you will\nendure a lonely death. But succeed, and the rewards are limitless. For those who accept the risk and grasp\nthe prize offered, the opportunities for fame and fortune are equal parts limitless and dangerous.\n\nRogue Traders are a disparate and varied bunch. Arch-militants see the galaxy as something to be overcome\nthrough force of arms, while the Seneschals see knowledge and information as the true paths to glory.\nThey are all united in their desire to extend the iron will of the Imperium through endeavor, fortune,\nand occasionally heresy, and now, for whatever reason, you are embarking into the God-Emperor's name."

That is where\nthe Rogue Traders come in. With a sacred Warrant of Trade,\nthey alone push into the unknown, bearing the God-Emperor's\nlight into the far reaches of the galaxy. Ambition knows\nno bounds indeed, for with each new find, every rumor,\nand every charted star comes the chance to alter\nthe course of history or lose themselves in the\nmaelstrom."

Perhaps you choose to embody a lethal soldier, wise scholar, inspiring leader, or\nsomething quite different. You may collaborate with a group of other players, each controlling their own\ncharacter. Together you will forge a story through your choices and actions in the game.\n\nRogue Trader provides a framework of rules to facilitate combat, interaction, and other game mechanics,\nbut the essence of play is the story you create with your fellow players. When performing an action that has\na chance of failure, the rules provide structure while the actual element of success would be determined by\nrolling dice. Another person, called the Game Master or GM, helps run the game for you and controls\npeople you encounter in game. The GM turns the blank canvas into the story you're playing through.\n\nWhat You Need To Play Rogue Trader\nYou'll need the following items:\n• People to play the game (2 to 5 plus one GM)\n• Three hours of gaming time\n• Some six-sided dice (ten or more per player)\n• Paper and pens to keep track of your character\n• Snacks, drinks, etc."

They are:\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section introduces the universe of Rogue Trader and roleplaying in general, with both rewarding and\nchallenging elements awaiting an Explorator or Astropath character. Unlike Acolytes, these characters\nare set apart from other psychically-gifted individuals and have a greater purpose.\n\nCHAPTER I: CHARACTER CREATION\nA step-by-step walkthrough of creating your character.\n\nCHAPTER II: CAREER PATHS\nThis presents the things your character is skilled at that can be traced back to what he did before becoming an Explorer and\nhow to explore and develop your character with these Career Paths and options available to you.\n\nCHAPTER III: SKILLS\nWhat your character has learned, skills that he can employ to get through the darkness and defend\nhimself. This chapter details these skills fully.\n\nCHAPTER IV: TALENTS\nThese are special traits that make him unique-from Bulging Biceps to Unshakeable Faith. This\nchapter details all of your character's special abilities."

      "text": "CHAPTER X: THE GAME MASTER\nThe GM has the hardest role to play in any roleplaying game. This chapter explains how best to fulfill\nthat role within Rogue Trader, exploring motivation and strategic guidance for an enriching campaign\nand experience as you delve into the universe of this book.\n\nCHAPTER XI: THE IMPERIUM\nThis chapter describes the Imperium of Man in its decaying, war-torn glory.\n\nCHAPTER XII: ROGUE TRADERS\nWhether in ROGUE TRADER you take the role of a Warrant-bearing noble yourself, or are the trusted ally\nwho accompanies him on his voyages, this chapter provides background details about these famed merchant\nfamilies and their history at the edges of known space.\n\nCHAPTER XIII: THE KORONUS EXPANSE\nThe Koronus Expanse is the core setting for ROGUE TRADER. This chapter provides an overview of the\nexpanse and important information about its planets, warp routes, and perilous destinations. This chapter\nshould give the GM plenty of material for running a ROGUE TRADER campaign.\n\nCHAPTER XIV: ADVERSARIES & ALIENS\nThis chapter includes a dramatis personae of deadly creatures and unknown hostile forces that can be\nfound in the Koronus Expanse, and provides background and battle stats for those the Explorers may\nencounter on their journeys.\n\nCHAPTER XV: INTO THE MAW\nAn introductory adventure to kick off their ROGUE TRADER campaign, taking a group of Explorers into\nthe Koronus Maw. Creating the appropriate Gateway into the darkness awaits them.\n\nGAME DICE\nROGUE TRADER uses ten-sided polyhedral dice for all game mechanics. These can be purchased from any\ngames store where this book was purchased. Each player and the GM will need at least two ten-sided dice,\npreferably of two different colors.\n\nA ten-sided die (often called a \"d10\") has numbers from 1 to 0, with the 0 counting as 10. When rolling a\npercentage roll, roll two differently colored dice. Count one as the tens digit of the result and one as the ones\ndigit. Different colored dice are helpful for distinguishing between these results. See also the Percentage Roll Examples\nbelow.\n\nNote that when rules refer to \"roll 2d10\" this means add the results of each die together, and not make a\npercentage roll. When rolling a \"d10\" we simply add the resulting number (1 through 10).\n\nEXAMPLE\nThe GM rolls two ten-sided dice, getting a 6 and a 3.\nIf using them for 2d10, that's 6+3=9.\nFor a percentile roll, that's 63%.\n\nSometimes, the rules require a roll of 1d5. To make this roll using a ten-sided die, divide the result by 2\n(rounding up).\n\nEXAMPLE\nTo generate 5d5 points of damage to deal with a point blank pistol shot at an enemy, the GM rolls a\nd10 and divides by 2, rounding up. The GM rolls an 8, which becomes 4 when divided by 2 and rounded\nup."

      "text": "In the 41st millennium, many battle aliens vying for dominance in a galaxy filled with horror. Those who would step beyond the threshold of what is known and venture into the uncharted darkness beyond the Imperium's borders are few indeed, for to do so is to invite almost certain death. Yet the Rogue Trader's Warrant of Trade allows them to go where others cannot, to seek out unfathomable wealth and glory on humanity's frontier.\n\nCHAPTER I: \nCHARACTER\nCREATION\n\nWhile countless teeming billions toil in the manufactories of hive worlds and defend the million worlds that comprise the Imperium from alien attack, a few privileged individuals travel beyond the boundaries of the Imperium into the unknown, where the laws of men are secondary to the laws of survival. These are the Rogue Traders, and they enjoy a level of personal freedom, power, and privilege that few can imagine and many rightly distrust. Each Rogue Trader operates under a Warrant of Trade, ancient charters issued personally or inherited by someone in their bloodline, that grants them a mandate to travel beyond the Emperor's realm into uncharted space. A Rogue Trader might secure alien technology, establish trade with newlydiscovered human worlds, make war upon aggressive alien races, or chart unknown regions—all in the name of the Emperor of Mankind. The risks a Rogue Trader undertakes are as manifold as the stars, and many vanish without trace. Those who succeed, however, gain wealth and fame beyond imagining.\n\nCREATING YOUR EXPLORER\nTo get started with ROGUE TRADER, you need to create who you will be playing with when you make your Player Character (PC, and often referred to simply as \"Explorer\"). You will find all the tools to construct an interesting character within this chapter, but there's no need to memorize everything—most of the details are organized in a simple, step-by-step process.\n\nConsult with your GM and your group of players to be playing with when you make your PC. Not only will you find it helpful to coordinate with them, but your characters will complement one another better if you work as a group.\n\nMaking an Explorer is relatively simple, especially if broken down into steps. Each step involves making selections to record on your character sheet. Each step follows a definite progression:"

      "text": "STAGE 6: SELECT EQUIPMENT\nSelect various items to record on your character sheet. Explorers may select additional weapons and equipment found in Chapter V: Armoury. Ideally, each character defined a number of items based on their Profit Factor and how charitable their Game Master is feeling.\n\nSTAGE 1: GENERATE CHARACTERISTICS\nSome of the most basic of these are called Characteristics. They represent your Explorer's capabilities, ranging from physical Characteristics (like Strength and Toughness) to mental ones (like Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship).\n\nSTAGE 2: THE ORIGIN PATH\nThis determines what you were before becoming an explorer. The Imperium is a vast civilization, and by the time your character reaches his adventure as an Explorer, his life has been influenced by different factors. The Origin Path Chart displays the main choices you will make. This Stage also determines the Wounds you have.\n\nSTAGE 3: SPEND EXPERIENCE POINTS\nThis step is where you can further customize your Explorer. Each character begins play with 500 Experience Points (XP) that reflects his life prior to becoming an Explorer. With XP, you may increase your Skills and Talents, or improve a Characteristic. Your chosen Career Path provides details.\n\nSTAGE 4: GIVING CHARACTERS LIFE\nWith numbers finished, flesh out your Explorer. This stage helps you define your character's motives, ideals, and personality. These are not hard mechanics for play, and your answers to these questions are for helping you determine who your character is, his mannerisms, what drives him to adventure, and how helping (or hindering) he might be to companions.\n\nSTAGE 5: PROFIT FACTOR AND SHIP POINTS\nMeasures of your group's wealth and power, and determines the starship your Warrant-holder has. Profit Factor, this step will help you decide your group's standing and wealth within the Imperium.\n\nSPENDING EXPERIENCE POINTS?\nSeveral options in this chapter allow your character a chance of gaining 500 Experience Points. Starting characters in ROGUE TRADER begin with 500 XP that they may spend according to their Career Path. See page 40 for more details on how to spend Experience Points and learn new abilities."

      "text": "STAGE 1:\nCHARACTERISTIC BONUSES\n\nEach Characteristic has a corresponding Characteristic Bonus equaling the tens digit of the Characteristic. For example, a character with a Strength of 43 has a Strength Bonus of 4. Generally, Characteristic Bonuses are used to determine the force of blows in combat or when Damage Rolls (DR) that have a variable component.\n\nGENERATE\nCHARACTERISTICS\n\nA character with a WS of 39 would have a WS Bonus of 3.\n\nGENERATING\nCHARACTERISTICS\n\nIn ROGUE TRADER, your character's Characteristics represent your character's ability across a variety of physical and mental attributes. To generate a Characteristic, roll 2d10, add the resulting numbers together, then add 25.\n\nFor example, roll a 7 and 10 = 17; 17+25 = 42.\n\nFollow this procedure once for each of your character's Characteristics.\n\nYour Characteristics are the most important for determining where your character's strengths and weaknesses lie, and for a variety of important purposes they affect how your character can succeed in certain actions since you will make dice rolls against your Characteristics to determine your chance of accomplishing something when the result has dramatic consequences. The higher your Characteristic rating above 01, the better off you will be.\n\nNote that Characteristics will later be further modified by choices you make during character generation. Once you've generated all of your character's Characteristics, you can choose to allocate them however you wish. Should you choose this latter option, keep these values in mind when deciding upon your character's Career Path.\n\nWeapon Skill (WS)\nWeapon Skill measures your character's competence in hand-to-hand fighting, whether using fists, knives or chainswords.\n\nBallistic Skill (BS)\nBallistic Skill reflects your character's accuracy with ranged weapons, from lasguns to bolters and plasma pistols.\n\nStrength (S)\nStrength describes how physically strong your character is.\n\nEXAMPLE\nTim needs to determine his character's Weapon Skill Characteristic score. He rolls 2d10 and gets 7+6=13. Adding 25 for a total of 38, Tim's character has a Weapon Skill of 38.\n\nToughness (T)\nToughness represents a character's ability to resist physical damage and pain. Characters with a high Toughness are hardy and resilient.\n\nAgility (Ag)\nAgility measures a character's quickness, reflexes, and poise.\n\nIntelligence (Int)\nIntelligence is a measurement of a character's knowledge, wisdom, and ability to reason logically.\n\nPerception (Per)\nPerception details how aware a character is of his surroundings, reflecting both attention to detail and intuition.\n\nWillpower (WP)\nWillpower demonstrates a character's mental fortitude, determination, and ability to withstand horrors that would break lesser men.\n\nFellowship (Fel)\nFellowship represents a character's ability to interact with others, to deceive, befriend, or command. Those with high Fellowship are often natural leaders.\n\nALLOCATING POINTS\nAn alternative method for generating characteristics is to have the player decide that he wishes to assign points. In this method, the player has 100 points total to allocate amongst the various Characteristics, adding these allocations to a base of 25 for each Characteristic. The only limitation is that no Characteristic can exceed a value of 35 before applying any modifiers gained during later character generation."

      "text": "STAGE 2: THE\nORIGIN PATH\n\nORIGIN PATH OPTIONS\nOne of the goals of the Origin Path system is to simplify character creation choices. Players can start playing faster, and provides automatic bonuses to characteristics. After reviewing the Origin Path Charts and deciding where you are going (via your Career Path), maybe you will be willing to follow your own path, which will be even more heavily connected to your character's background.\n\nAnother option gaining popularity among Explorers is not to be constrained by Origin Path choices. For instance, a High Navigator, Terran Vassal, Maximus Val II is not constrained until you make a choice for the entire group.\n\nThe Origin Path system is based on a chart that represents a character's abilities through a series of choices made by the player. This chart shows the varied backgrounds that different characters from the same Origin can have. Starting the process of creating Origin Paths for your characters, you will find common threads, and evidence of one's past having an impact on another's.\n\nIt is suggested that players should use different colored pencils or pens to help track each path chart, but simply labeling each Path with a distinctive number works fine too. Paths can be read either from top-to-bottom or from bottom-to-top, whichever is the preference of the player. The charts are written open-ended, but of course choices dictate that one is limited in planning.\n\nINTERSECTIONS\nThe Origin Path system helps identify areas where characters have common histories or links. Where two Origin Paths intersect, the one directly below represents a single choice Intersection. Instead of calculating the characters' shared paths at the conclusion, read them during play as they arise, discovering these background connections along the way.\n\nEXAMPLE\nAaron has selected Void Born as his Home World. He chooses Stubjack for his Birthright, and Scapegrace for his Lure of the Void.\n\nEXAMPLE\nHe then spots the intersections between his Home World choice (Void Born) and Birthright choice (Stubjack). Keeping track of these will help provide a fully-developed back-story for Aaron's character and provide opportunities for interaction with other characters with similar backgrounds.\n\nOnce a player has completed his Origin Path, it creates connections between characters. Recording these selections with a distinctive mark (perhaps using a colored highlighter) provides both the players and the Game Master useful hooks for future plot development.\n\nOnce the player has completed his Origin Path, it determines the Characteristics, Wounds, Fate Points, and Skills and Talents from reviewing the text for every selection. These bonuses and penalties are cumulative.\n\nTHE ORIGIN PATH, SKILLS AND TALENTS: THE SEQUEL\nIf the same Skill appears from two or more different sources, you gain Skill Mastery (see Page 74) in that Skill. When you gain the same Talent more than once from different sources, you may, at the GM's discretion, exchange the redundant Talent for the Talented (choose one) Talent instead. This is useful for future plots based on hidden depths, revelations of previous training, or omitted details from character's secrets."

      "text": "HOME WORLD OPTIONS\nYour companion not only accepts his fate, but can face death without fear when allied with his comrades. Usually, the companionship of a hardened world veteran represents his greatest personal achievement. For colonists and settlers of Death Worlds, nothing holds the status that successful conflict against the hostile local environment does. The machine spirits walk and guard still, and can achieve the most impressive feats before his death, the likes of which the mid-hive spire-dwelling have never pledged to any authority.\n\nStruggling descendant of a death worlder actually has advantages compared to someone nurtured in raided cities. After all, he has already seen the worst the galaxy has to offer; so clearly nothing else could exceed the horrors of his Death World.\n\nDeath World Characters\nA Death World character's background affects many of his facets: physical abilities, skills, temperament, appearance, and outlook. Death World characters may chance upon those who have travelled to Careers paths of various kinds. Selecting your Home World from Void-Maw to Zeknerekh, characters may recognize many of the types described below as Home Worlds of other missionaries; or they may come from completely unexplored craggy locales.\n\nWhatever you have chosen your Home World, write down your Skills and Talents, then move on to the next stage.\n\nDEATH WORLD\nCharacteristic Modifiers: +3 Strength, +3 Toughness, -3 Fellowship\nStarting Skills: All death worlders are adept at resisting the rigors of hostile environments. Death worlders gain the Survival (Int) skill trained.\n\nHardened: Death workers are tough specimens. In addition to their increased Toughness from being raised on a death world, death world characters start with one of the following Talents: Jaded, Resistance (Poisons), or Resistance (Fear).\n\nKill It: Most death worlds possess incredibly dangerous flora and fauna, both hostile to human life, and inhabitants must find any means necessary to combat them. Many death worlds are utterly remote, having had scant contact with the rest of humanity for centuries. While this breeds superior examples of the human race who are tough and resilient, the inherently dangerous conditions of a death world encourage paranoia. Death worlders tend to be slow to put their faith in anyone other than themselves.\n\nLife on a Death World while some among the Death worlds within the Imperium can be counted among the verdant paradises of Fenris, teaching a man to survive amidst the dangers of these worlds is a rare achievement indeed.\n\nDeath World Characters double their starting Toughness Bonus and add 1d5+2 to the result to determine their starting number of Wounds.\n\nStarting Fate Points: Roll 1d10 to determine a death world character's starting Fate Points. On a 1-5, he begins with 2 Fate Points; on a 6-9, he begins with 3 Fate Points; on a 10, he begins with 4 Fate Points."

      "text": "VOID BORN\nTo be thrown thousands of light years off course or to drift for centuries in the void between stars or to catch a glimpse of something truly inhuman are all constant dangers to those who ply the trackless wastes between the worlds of the Emperor's domain. Each offers only the constantly wandering lifestyle of the Void-born. For those born in the warp itself, the harsh isolation and dangers of ships navigating through the Warp's malefic realm where anything might happen without warning has made you quite different. You have been raised in the company of cold engines and dark cabins and what others call normal is alien to you.\n\nYears may elapse between fleets responding to distress calls, and vessels on routine patrols have been known to arrive months or years after they were called upon. Those who live their lives void-borne are scarred by the main-altering rigors of the darkness between worlds.\n\nNot merely star travelers but the products of many generations living in the darkness between worlds, the void born dwell in Zero-gravity environments and form a relatively few among the teeming multitudes of humanity, but they are singular, and form a separate and odd collection of misunderstood humanity, perhaps birthed in the cold depths of space onboard a trader vessel whose crew has spent centuries charting courses through asteroid anomalies aboard drifting hulks in orbit around failing worlds, or whose families have lived and toiled for what these hosts call individual generations—often considered a strange people by others. Though outwardly normal, both uncertain and varied, the void born have common features that set them apart. Pale and drawn, with haunted, sunken eyes, many may have minor deformities or a strangeness of speech or general appearance that sets them apart from others. Some, although outwardly normal, carry something strange about them that isn't quite right.\n\nLife as a Void Born\nFrom Imperial Navy warships to Mechanicus Explorator fleets, the inhabitants of the Imperium's countless void installations—mining installations, penitentiary barges, orbital laboratories and research platforms—come from a variety of backgrounds onboard active vessels. Space travel in the Imperium is dangerous and prone to perilous mishaps. Most interstellar journeys are undertaken using powerful warp drives that breach the barriers between real space and the nightmare dimension known as the Warp. Within the Warp, a ship can cover thousands of light years within relatively short voyage time, whilst Imperial crew and passengers crouch behind the ship's Gellar fields, cowering in terror beyond the ship's bulkhead walls. Such journeys through the Warp have driven many insane, their minds unable to comprehend the horrors of space and the sheer magnitude of the dangers they must overcome.\n\nStarting Skills: Void born speak a dialect unique to their home vessel. Void Born gain the Speak Language (Ship Dialect) Skill.\n\nCharmed: The void born are touched by the fickle powers of the warp, making them preternaturally lucky. Whenever a void born character spends a Fate Point (though not if he burns a Fate Point), roll 1d10. On the roll of a natural 10, the void born immediately regains the Fate Point he just spent.\n\nGauge Distance: Due to their unusual background, void born are accustomed to perceiving distances differently from those born on planets. Because of this, void born gain Navigation (Stellar) (Int) and Pilot (Space Craft) (Ag) as trained Basic Skills for a void born character.\n\nAccustomed to Crowds: Trained from childhood to maximize space in the cramped confines of voidships and space stations, void born characters count as being one size category smaller for the purposes of calculating Difficult Terrain. In addition, void born characters trained in the Contortionist skill count as being two size categories smaller for these calculations.\n\nStarting Wounds: Void born characters double their starting Toughness Bonus and add 1d5 to the result to determine their starting number of Wounds.\n\nStarting Fate Points: Roll 1d10 to determine a void born character's starting Fate Points. On a 1-3, he begins with 2 Fate Points; on a 4-7, he begins with 3 Fate Points; on a 8-10, he begins with 4 Fate Points."

You have been branded from birth and conditioned to find your place in the great system and fulfill your duty to service the Machine God. This process has forged you mentally and physically to a role of manual and technical labor to serve your tech-masters of the Omnissiah. This \"forge-grinding\" process has fired you well for manual and technical roles in life.\n\nThe Adeptus Mechanicus maintain an iron-handed monopoly over the most powerful and ancient technology, and beyond the forge worlds this plethora of knowledge is rarely available. Each forge world's entire infrastructure consists of endless scriptorums, databanks, generatoria, laboratories, and manufactorums tended by countless generations of tech-adepts who toil under the guidance of the magi of the Cult Mechanicus.\n\nLife on a Forge World\nForge worlds such as the Lathe Worlds of the Calixis Sector are domains of the Priesthood of Mars themselves, where the inconceivable demands of the Imperium's voracious macro-industries consume the lives of uncounted billions. World-spanning manufactoriums churn out munitions, weapons, and other vital technologies for the armies of the Emperor. Innumerable regiments of Skitarii Tech-Guard are raised from their populations to defend the Imperium from alien attack. The people toiling on a forge world are a slightly more technical breed of stock than those on other worlds, a breed forged for war and the dominance of humanity over the galaxy.\n\nA forge world's metal culture is typically harsher than hive worlds due to its rigidly enforced order and the cold logic of the tech-priests who command it. Still there are many differences between these worlds, and the souls that inhabit each one might not recognize each other as kin beyond the sacred rituals of the Omnissiah, for they have been shaped in myriad ways by the daily rigors of their existence.\n\nCharacteristic Modifiers: +3 Intelligence, -3 Fellowship\nStarting Skills: Common Lore (Tech) (Int) and Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int) are trained Basic Skills for forge world characters.\n\nOmnissiah's Chosen: Rather than being fully indoctrinated into the Imperial Cult, even the lowliest member of a forge world society is brought up to properly venerate the spirits of the machine. All forge world characters start with the Technical Knock Talent and the Common Lore (Tech) Skill.\n\nBecause forge world characters are typically not tolerant of what they see as bloody-minded superstition and witless dogma, they suffer a -10 penalty to Fellowship Tests involving the Ecclesiarchy or formal servants of the Imperial Creed.\n\nStarting Wounds: Forge world characters double their starting Toughness Bonus and add 1d5-1 to the result to determine their starting number of Wounds.\n\nStarting Fate Points: Roll 1d10 to determine the forge world character's starting Fate Points.

      "text": "HIVE WORLD\nThe great Imperium of Mankind spans thousands of planets. The size of these worlds is vast and incredibly diverse; some are paradise worlds, others forge worlds. The most common of all Imperial worlds are not least because they are where the majority of Mankind live. At the teeming heart of these worlds stand the mighty hive cities: enormous man-made mountains of plasteel and rockcrete that can cover vast stretches of the surface from horizon to horizon.\n\nThese worlds house billions of people and manufacture goods for the Emperor's vast armies. These hives blend metallurgy, manufacturing and other vital industries that churn out endless streams of weapons, chemicals and other essential supplies. Others have become so polluted that the surface is completely toxic and the atmosphere cannot support life outside the artificial environments of the underhives.\n\nLife on a Hive World\nHive worlds are the most populous planets in the Imperium and are essential to the economy and war machine of the Emperor's domains. They are industrial worlds producing vast quantities of manufactured goods for the Imperial Guard's never-ending wars. Innumerable regiments of Imperial Guard are raised from their teeming populations.\n\nWhilst most hive cities are unique and produce different products, the nature of the planet they occupy commonly results in the surface beyond the hive becoming increasingly toxic and polluted over the centuries. Only the wealthy can afford to live in the upper sections of such a city. It is here that the ruling nobles, merchant barons, and industrial leaders who enjoy lives of luxury and comfort dwellers unknown to those who maintain the systems upon which their wealthy masters feed.\n\nBelow the gilded spires lies the vast bulk of the working hive. Below this point lies the great bulk of a hive city's population—concentrations of humanity so great as to beggar description, entire continents of men and women bound by draconian restrictions upon freedom of movement or reproduction lest they risk the entire system's collapse.\n\nBelow the working hive stretches the underhive. Below this point lies the world of the underhive, lawless regions where order, law, and sometimes even Imperial Creed fall into ruin. The deeper one gets from the heavily regulated industrial centers of the hive, the worse conditions become and the more toxic and lethal the environment. Only the destitute and the outcast, the scavengers and outlaws willingly make their home in the darkness below. The underhives are frontiers within a hive, often considered a necessary evil both as a place to rid a hive of undesirables and a buffer between the working hive and dangers that might lurk in the darkness below. They separate the hive's bottom from the desolate, polluted wastes of a hive world's surface.\n\nHive World Characters\nYou were born in the shadow of a great hive or have spent the majority of your life in the underhives, eking out an existence until death. Some aspire to better lives, driven by the urge for wealth, pleasure, and power; you are such a young adventurer, resourceful and quick-witted from your confrontational upbringing.\n\nCharacteristic Modifiers: +3 Toughness, -3 Fellowship\nStarting Skills: Hive Worlders are surrounded by ancient technologies throughout their lives, each one unique in its own way. Hive worlders gain the Speak Language (Hive Dialect) (Int) as a trained Basic Skill.\n\nAccustomed to Crowds: Hivers grow up surrounded by throngs of humanity. They can slip through the densest of crowds without slowing their pace. Hivers do not count Difficult Terrain for crowds, and if required to take an Agility Test to move nimbly through an area, they gain a +10 bonus to the Test.\n\nCaves of Steel: Hivers, surrounded their lives by the metal of their hives' industry, learn the mysteries of technology at an early age. Hivers treat the Tech-Use (Int) skill as a trained Basic Skill.\n\nWidescreen: Hivers are acclimated to the narrow corridors of a hive's innards, but are less inured to the indignity of the great outdoors. They suffer a -10 penalty to Survival (Int) Tests and, whilst outside of a starship or other enclosed environment, to any Awareness Tests.\n\nWary: Hivers are constantly alert for the first hint of trouble, be it a gang shoot-out, hab riot, or earthquake. All hivers gain a +1 Intelligence Bonus when calculating their starting number of Wounds.\n\nStarting Wounds: Hive World characters double their starting Toughness Bonus and add 1d5-1 to the result to determine their starting number of Wounds.\n\nStarting Fate Points: Roll 1d10 to determine a hive world character's starting Fate Points. On a 1-3, he begins with 2 Fate Points; on a 4-8, he begins with 3 Fate Points; on a 9-10, he begins with 4 Fate Points."

You were raised according to the strictest regimens of the Imperial Creed and your father enforced proper respect towards these constrained backgrounds. Whether your previous calling was as a noble administrator, a military officer, or a simple hive worker, you have been embroiled in the endless war that consumes the Imperium.\n\nLife on an Imperial World\nThe Imperium covers a vastly vast area of the galaxy that it is impossible to conceive of a \"typical\" Imperial World. No such thing exists. Amongst the uncounted worlds of the Imperium are Agri-worlds and feral worlds, industrial hives and mining colonies, shrine worlds, penitentiary worlds, and cardinal worlds at the heart of an entire sector's faith in the God-Emperor. Each exists to produce something for the Imperium and devotion to the God-Emperor is expected and tolerated by the powers-that-be. Common people place great faith in the Imperial Creed taught by the Ecclesiarchy as they are inculcated with its words and doctrines from their earliest days, brought up to believe that it will guide and protect them against the horrors of the galaxy.\n\nWhilst each world of the Imperium is charged with enforcing the will of the Imperium and maintaining proper control of its people, there are worlds that stand apart from the Imperium's rule. Stranger and more rare are worlds that are utterly remote, having had no contact with the rest of humanity in centuries. This cultural isolation has led to a broad diversity of cultures and societies and affects what is expected from a planet's local ruler. The more important, well-governed planets in the Calixis Sector are more likely to be frontier worlds where law and order has broken away from the dogmatic constraints of Imperial Tithes.\n\nImperial World Characters\nTo have broken away from the dogmatic constraints of Imperial life, your character is either of exceptional spirit or have remarkable potential. The heritage of your home world might that of Holy Terra itself, whilst others have devolved into feudal worlds of barely post-Stone Age technology. They may be hard-pressed to defend a planet from the periphery of the Imperium or peacefully colonised during times of conflict. You have undoubtedly served the Imperial Creed with true, honest obedience to the teachings of the Ministorium. There is nothing quite so pure as life on such a civilized world, and you alone embark into the God-Emperor's name.\n\nCharacteristic Modifiers: +3 Willpower, -3 Perception\nBlessed Ignorance: Imperial citizens know the proper and correct way of doing things through superstition, folklore, and doctrine, filtered by the generations that have gone before them through the lens of local custom. As a result, Imperial citizens suffer a -10 penalty on Forbidden Lore (Int) Tests.\n\nHagiography: Most Imperial citizens believe that most major scientific advances in the Imperium came from the rediscovery of forgotten technology or, more importantly, the blessed works of the Emperor or his saints. Technology is maintained through a sequence of learned practices rather than genuine understanding. Imperial worlders gain Common Lore (Imperial Creed) (Int), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int) or Common Lore (War) (Int) as trained Basic Skills.\n\nLiturgical Familiarity: Accustomed to the zealous and the faithful, Imperial citizens are accustomed to the Ecclesiarchy. Common Lore (Administratum) (Int) and Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int) are untrained Basic Skills.\n\nStarting Wounds: Imperial world characters double their starting Toughness Bonus and add 1d5 to the result to determine their starting number of Wounds.\n\nStarting Fate Points: Roll 1d10 to determine an Imperial world character's starting Fate Points. On a 1-5, he begins with 2 Fate Points; on a 6-8, he begins with 3 Fate Points; on a 9-10, he begins with 4 Fate Points."

Also, due to his family connections, he gains an additional Peer (choose one: Administratum, Adeptus Mechanicus, Astropaths, Government, Mercantile, or Underworld) Talent.\n\nEnemy: Even the most connected and charismatic of Rogue Traders make enemies, and a noble born character has so many powerful enemies that at least one of them is a serious and formidable threat. Whilst they might not kill him whenever convenient, this enemy (or enemies) will seize upon any opportunity to dog the character's steps through life.

And if it was nailed down, you acquired the nails too.\n\nYours was a hard life lived upon a knife-edge—the dark abyss on one side and death on the other—where each day's survival was a triumph.

Human individuals are declared outcast by Imperial crime lords and have no recourse but to flee to the life you now lead.

You have undertaken some remarkable individual such as you, however capable of drawing upon reserves of iron will and self-reliance few can hope to match, but such endurance can be a two-edged sword. To add and brave the tides of the empyrean, you know that survival is first and foremost. The void born whisper that your ill-luck will follow you wherever you go. Although some may tolerate your presence until the day you find another ship and view another dawn, you know that every step taken is another step away from some of the doom you have escaped.\n\nEffect: Choose one of the following results and apply it to your character.\nAgainst the Odds: You gain the Survival Skill (making it a trained Basic Skill if you already possess it) or the Dark Soul Talent. Additionally, whenever you must make a Fate Point reroll (see page 233), you may re-roll the dice if you wish but must accept the second result even if it is worse.\nUnwilling Accomplice: Thanks to your shadowed past, you have picked up skills and knowledge on the way that you would not normally have access to. You gain a single Skill of your choice as a trained Basic Skill. Additionally, you suffer -5 to Fellowship when dealing with void born and other voidfarers who are not personal friends if they have heard of your background and reputation.\nJealous Freedom: Having endured captivity once, you react violently towards the prospect of imprisonment of any kind. You must pass a Willpower Test to prevent this (modified by the GM) of encountering security systems or a voidfarer counter when threatened with a jail cell.\n\nDARK VOYAGE\nThe stories told in the mess halls and galleys filled with travellers, and recounting the dread of void-farers when the lumen globes have dimmed, these folk will tell legends of hard luck vessels, how hull-breaches were created by the lost and warp spoors that howl with mocking voices of the things that claw and scratch at the hull, reaching out for the merest flicker of the Gellar Field, for the warp beyond will devour any it touches with wholesale ravening sentience.\n\nBut you have no taste for such stories because you know they are true. You have led them yourself, and have stared into the eyes of the abyss and lived. You have seen the dead walk and the bulkheads bleed, and know such experiences tear at the thin veneer of civilization worn by many, revealing both the darkness that hides in mankind beneath the surface of things and whether you have recoiled in fear or clung to your honour regardless, you hold no illusions about what may lurk beyond the hull plate where Man was not meant to tread. You may even have learned the hard way that a single bolt shell bought with a Lord Commander's ransom and that single well-aimed shot cannot be guessed at, but all your experience has grasped you at some level beyond darkness.\n\nEffect: You gain a single Forbidden Lore Skill pertaining to your experience (gain one level in the Forbidden Lore Skill you already possess) or a Resistance Talent of your choice.\n\nBred in Adversity: You gain the Light Sleeper Talent and your choice of the Hardy Talent or Nerves of Steel Talent, but you suffer 1d5 Insanity Points and -3 to Willpower for the next test involving the particular danger you faced."

      "text": "HIGH VENDETTA\nYou once had station and wealth, so it seems that everything you could have ever wanted, everything you could ever need. All stood before you—honour, friendship, loyalty. But to you they were empty words. Gone in a storm of Thrones. You must leave them and the great house and rank they represent, lest they are tools for survival. Without them you are nothing. You are only grateful that you are still the same person at the end of it, having looked into the cold darkness of space and prey to enemies and rivals without number, with their countless myriad ways of seeking amidst the mind and the soul.\n\nEffect: You gain your choice of the Dark Fate or the Paranoia Talent.\n\nVENGEANCE\nPerhaps you are the last survivor of a blood feud or simply the murderous retainer of a faction involved in a vendetta that consumed your life and sent friends to their graves. Whatever your role, vengeance now burns within your heart, flaming afresh when you catch sight of an old enemy or the reminder of a past wrong, the image of which haunts your sleep, and darkens your every action. You live, but with each step you take, you move closer to revenge. \"Vengeance is mine,\" the creed guides you, and it will do so until the day you stand above the bloody corpses of your enemies. And what then?\n\nEffect: You gain your choice of the Die Hard or Paranoia Talent.\n\nBlood Will Have Blood: You gain your choice of Inquiry Skill (or if you already have it, gain one level in this skill) or Scrutiny Skill.\n\nBrook No Insult: You will allow no serious offense to your person or those who are under your protection to pass unchallenged. When meeting insult with violence and superiority, you may use your Strength Bonus modified by the provocation and the consequence of succumbing to your rage (modified by the GM) of succumbing to your anger.\n\nYou gain the Hatred (choose one) Talent as specified by the GM.\n\nRENOWN\nThe Imperium is undying. Nothing new and every world within the confines of void, countless billions toil and strive to die unknown, faceless, unimportant, and unmarked. Whether driven by burning ambition, greed, revenge, glory, wrath, vanity, or machinations, there must be some compelling reason that someone leaves his home world behind and endures the journey into the unknown.\n\nThrough your actions and victories you will ensure that your name will be spoken by the multitudes yet to be born, into the distant millennia ahead. You will gather the best and the brightest to your allegiance and then achieve such great deeds that those who come after you cannot help but look down upon your long record.\n\nEffect: You gain your choice of the Air of Authority or the Peer (choose one) Talent.\n\nENDURANCE\nYou are enduring. You have seen the encroaching darkness a thousand times. You have persevered through injury, pain, anguish, and murderous foes of unnatural strength. You have been knocked down, torn apart, and then achieved such heights again. Endure and you shall be made mighty in the God-Emperor's eyes and the vaunted halls of the Imperium.\n\nEffect: You gain your choice of the Air of Authority or the Peer (choose one) Talent.\n\nPRIDE\nIt is your pride that has made you strong—strong enough to withstand the burning winds and storms that would surely break a lesser mortal. Your pride has allowed you to survive struggle and want. Others would put self-preservation above all else; you expect the admiration of your allies for your successes and will countenance no challenge from your foes. Yet too high a pride goeth before a mighty fall, and bred of ignorance, that pride may bring you contempt rather than the honor you feel you have earned. For the sake of your own high standards, you push yourself hard, and demand no less from those around you.\n\nEffect: You gain your choice of the Talented (choose one) Talent or the Peer (choose one) Talent.\n\nFORTUNE\nPerhaps there are countless Thrones to be gained with wealth and countless more burning a hole in your pocket, but you are not wholly motivated by world's wealth. Regardless of the distinction that draws you into the void and demonstrating your worth through your actions and your courage, the galaxy may literally begin with the clink, clink of three gold coins dropped upon a honesty-stained counter. Many will rise to take their words and talents (or their weapons and guile) to the highest bidder. Perhaps your ultimate goals are business ventures. Perhaps they are downright despicable. Either way, you have a cunning path to follow, and a burning desire to gain experiences that few could dream of."

The remaining 4,000 XP, spent prior to the character's Origin Path, Skills, and other abilities. This initial amount of XP is equivalent to a Rank 1 character, providing the character with 4,500 XP total, spent prior to the beginning of play.\n\nBeginning characters start with their Career's Rank 1 Advances and may spend additional XP to increase Characteristics, acquire new Skills and Talents, and generally become more proficient in their chosen occupation.\n\nSee Chapter II: Career Paths for more information on Ranks.

You will find both men and women with complete mixture of Low and High Gothic forms. The Imperium contains so many names and naming conventions that almost anything \"normal\" will do, as will made-up names like Malenkovich or Sebellian.

Perhaps your wings extend from the lowest pits to the highest places, and your slice the loose ends of your upbringing they hide away with the foxes and you need your wine sweet and your enemies bitter. Veterans end up nowhere and no one is quite so valued as one who has shown his value and has attempted the attention of your betters. Your character is the sum total of your career moves and your reality. The background details of your character's life are largely your own to determine. While some people develop their characters during play, maybe there are things about your past that you seek out and that haunt your dreams every quiet moment, memories rising unbidden.\n\nIf this is your first time roleplaying, consider asking yourself the following questions to flesh out your character. When you start to play, know that your character level is literally someone who is just starting as a new recruit onto this endeavour. Perhaps your wealth has purchased you a death world Arch-militant who has left Port Wander to secure his fate aboard this vessel. Or maybe you are a renowned Rogue Trader or bodyguard companion for one of the players' Explorers, whose background and present position is however much you prefer it to be. Under the auspices of play time again, you need to help fleshing out your character's background and beliefs for some time until you can give your GM a sufficient hook he can use with your history.\n\nWHY DOES THE KORONUS EXPANSE CALL TO YOU?\nThe Koronus Expanse region in the Halo Stars beyond the Calixis Sector offers profit, death, and wealth beyond measure awaiting those brave enough to claim it. It is the rock upon which fortunes have been made and Rogue Traders have been broken. Some seek to spread Imperial glory into a savage frontier. Some seek to bring the cleansing light of the Emperor to lost worlds. While for others, the chance of fame, fortune, and alien tech worth a king's ransom beckons them from the frontier.\n\nYour purpose for leaving the protection of the starfar beacon, the Astronomican—driving your starship forth from a threat and into the void beyond the Halo Stars—what is that lust that calls you? Treasure? The honor that can be bought with artefacts of the Emperor-sworn duty and devotion to extending the Imperial frontiers? Are you running from Imperial powers? Are you pursuing vengeance against one who fled into the Stars? Perhaps you chase forbidden lore that had eluded the seekers of the Imperium? Secret knowledge itself is your goal.\n\nWHAT WILL YOU SACRIFICE?\nAll too many people reach their final victories standing by the corpse of all they once were. How deep are the wounds you will suffer along the path to wealth, fame, and power? How many of your dearly held beliefs will die along the way? Are you willing to risk your life, your sanity, your health, your kin, your honour above the quest requires it? Will you betray your allies, others who you once trusted, taking their lives or sacrificing them so that you might push forward for fame and glory? Did the God-Emperor lay this in your path, or is this your own selfish ambition? Are you willing to step from the path of the faithful, and turn to darker, unhallowed powers to find that which you seek? And if so, can you live with the consequences?\n\nWHAT IS YOUR DEMEANOUR?\nPerhaps the first question about your personality is: what are you like? Fiery and passionate, practical and surly, or patient and calm? Do you feel deeply about matters, or are you even-tempered and slow to provoke? Here are some examples of the classic demeanors, each of which might get you noticed or killed.\n\nCholeric: Angry and quick-tempered, often passing judgment rapidly without extensive reflection. Things are definitive for a choleric.\n\nConstant: Stoic, calm and deep, and very difficult to truly provoke.\n\nMelancholic: Thoughtful, introspective, and prone to deep despair.\n\nMutable: Unpredictable, undisciplined, and rebellious.\n\nPhlegmatic: Peaceful and careful yet ambitious.\n\nSanguine: Confident and optimistic but prone to flights of fancy. Easily led."

      "text": "WHAT IS YOUR AMBITION?\nAmbition drives Rogue Traders to explore beyond the boundaries of Imperial space, for wealth, for power, for the God-Emperor. In what way will your name be sown through the ages? What is your ambition? Perhaps you desire for your sword to command a powerful House? Is it fame that you seek, or wealth? Perhaps you desire a governorship among the Emperor's planets? Perhaps your desire is religious in nature—to regain the lost human souls of the Halo Stars? Or are your aims altogether less lofty but no less noble? Rogue Trader or Arch-militant, Warp-witch or Imperial Guard, whether you begin your lost faith in the Imperial Creed or through the Machina, your driving ambition races your enemies, ancient xeno-tech that in Mechanicus hands could spell doom for an entire region. Kill them! Your ambition! Ambition knows no bounds, if only you are man enough to grasp it.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR HATREDS?\nSome are undecided, while others burn with passionate hatred. The Imperial virtues are hate, suspicion, and judgment; you know what you hate, and defense is surrender. Whether your hatred burns cold or white-hot, consider whether you despise the alien. Are you the sort who cleans his weapons nightly to prepare for the next encounter? Do you despise the feral, simple faith of conquered worlds? Do you merely resent the hated bureaucratic minions who administer the quotas upon your home colony? You may hate the vile Ork or treacherous Eldar; Mankind has many enemies who deserve punishment—decide upon your enemies and give them the distinctive flair of your personal loathing.\n\nPROFIT FACTOR\nRogue Traders are motivated by Profit Factor. Rogue Traders have considerable influence through their Warrant of Trade; representing the wealth that a Rogue Trader commands and those individuals in his retinue with whom he shares his bounty. The more successful a Rogue Trader becomes, the more opportunities for success present themselves. Using this rule, the GM determines the starting Profit Factor using Table 1-5.\n\nSTAGE 5: PROFIT FACTOR AND SHIP POINTS\n\nSTARTING PROFIT FACTOR\nMost Rogue Trader dynasties consist not of hard currency like Thrones but of networks, pacts between Merchant Houses, Adeptus administratum authorities, favors, commodities, property, and the Warrant of Trade. A Warrant of Trade is the source of a Rogue Trader's power, whose reputation, connections, and mandate provide endless opportunities for success.\n\nProfit Factor represents the relative power that a Rogue Trader dynasty can command. A Warrant of Trade that faces aggrieved challengers or that cannot accomplish its goals is not as valuable. For a Rogue Trader, it takes strong allies, trusted friends, and a wise counsellor to reach the dizzying heights that most Profit Factor represents. The relative power, rank, wealth, and other factors of a Rogue Trader's dynasty will add directly into the amount of Ship Points with which an Explorer's group begins.\n\nConsult Table 1-5: Starting Profit Factor and Ship Points to determine your group's starting Profit Factor for your Rogue Trader group."

      "text": "SHIP POINTS\nDARK HERESY CHARACTERS AND ROGUE TRADER\nA significant element of a Rogue Trader's operation is the mighty starship with which he treads the void. Yet few ships are created equal. The Nostromo and The Claw of Solomon may both be Rogue Trader vessels, but one is a patched-together Dauntless-class light cruiser while the other is a mighty Lunatic-class grand cruiser.\n\nPlayers familiar with Dark Heresy will know about Rogue Trader already. The systems used by both games share the same core mechanics and take place within the same universe. To represent this, here are several guidelines for using Dark Heresy characters in ROGUE TRADER.\n\nShip Points are spent on purchasing a customized ship (see Chapter VIII: Starships for details). Ship Points are added directly from your starting Profit Factor. A Profit Factor of 37 would generate 37 Ship Points.\n\nAfter determining your Explorers' Profit Factor, the Game Master uses the following guidelines.\n\nSince the Inquisition often makes use of Rogue Traders in its affairs, many Acolytes find themselves aboard the vessels of a Rogue Trader. Many Acolytes have diverse specialties much like those found on the ships of the Warrant-bearers, whether they be alien-hunters, heretic-chasers, or daemonic investigators.\n\nDARK HERESY characters may be transported onto a Tradership if an Inquisitor feels a particular cult or heretical group that the Rogue Trader is likely to encounter needs investigation. While the Rogue Trader is the nominal commander of his ship and crew, the Acolytes serve the Emperor directly, which makes for uncomfortable alliances. The Inquisitor sends his Acolytes where the Imperium needs watchful eyes, and sometimes this brings them into contact with a number of characters from ROGUE TRADER.\n\nSTAGE 6: SELECT EQUIPMENT\nOnce the Explorers have generated their initial Profit Factor and starship, the group uses their starting Profit Factor to make one Acquisition (see page 272) of a single item from Chapter V: Armoury with an Acquisition Modifier of +0.\n\nThese are merely some of the many possibilities! However, this second option produces a higher power level than starting out in DARK HERESY, and keeping characters of both games balanced requires a great deal of time and effort from the GM. A starting character in ROGUE TRADER is roughly equivalent to a DARK HERESY character who has gained about 6,500-7,000 XP.\n\nDark Heresy characters entering the employ of a Rogue Trader do not gain the full benefits of Profit Factor. Dark Heresy characters do not contribute to the group's Profit Factor and only gain Profit Factor at the GM's discretion. Similarly, ROGUE TRADER characters who join a Dark Heresy campaign retain their own abilities and training, but cannot use their connections or status to aid the group. On the other hand, well-connected Rogue Trader characters could find themselves down-shifted if the GM wants to adjust the character to better fit his skills and abilities within a DARK HERESY group's Profit Factor or Influence."

Beginning with your Home World selection and culminating in your Career (see page 7), ROGUE TRADER is a journey into an unknown fortune with the power behind the throne responsible for making your Career Path complete. In this chapter, you will find the following information about your character and how you could advance him while stepping beyond the oppressive control of the Imperium of Mankind, past boundaries into the darkness that surrounds us.\n\nYour Career Path represents your character's abilities and defining traits, both who you were before you ventured beyond the Imperium's borders into the void and what skills and abilities you can learn—and by what means you will become wealthy, powerful, and revered for service in the 41st Millennium.\n\nOriginally, each Career Path in ROGUE TRADER was designed to fulfill a specific crew role aboard a Rogue Trader vessel and give the character the best chance of success in the grim darkness of the far future. Rogue Traders are a disparate and varied bunch. Arch-militants see the galaxy as something to be overcome through force of arms, while the Seneschals see knowledge and information as the true paths to glory. They are all united in their desire to extend the iron will of the Imperium through endeavor, fortune, and occasionally heresy, and now, for whatever reason, you are embarking into the God-Emperor's name."

      "text": "CHARACTER ADVANCEMENTS\nYour character's Career Path Advancement Chart is typically divided into a series of Ranks. This chart (particularly the Characteristic Advance Scheme) represents a character's progression as levels of Character Advancement. There are three fairly simple progression categories: Simple, Intermediate, and Trained. Essentially, these indicate how easily a character can improve his capabilities in certain areas (plus some game mechanics). The Characteristic Advance Scheme shows the Experience Point cost for advancing a Characteristic at these different promotion levels.\n\nFor example, increasing Weapon Skill is Simple for a Rogue Trader. The Simple promotion level costs 250 XP for the first improvement, Intermediate promotion level costs 500 XP, while Trained promotion level costs 750 XP; an Expert promotion level would cost 1,000 XP. Each Characteristic has its own Advance Scheme rating for each Career Path. See the Characteristic Advance Scheme charts for each Career Path.\n\nEXAMPLE\nDarian wants to increase the Willpower of his Rogue Trader character by 5 points. His initial Willpower is 30 and it will cost him 250 XP to buy his first +5 advance. Once he's spent this, his Willpower will be 35. If Darian wants to improve his Willpower even further, he needs to spend 500 XP to buy the second +5 advance. When Darian does this, his Rogue Trader's Willpower will be 40.\n\nTABLE 2-1: CAREERS\nCareer | Description\n-------|------------\nRogue Trader | Master of a Warrant of Trade—fated to command vessels with grace and power.\nArch-militant | Master of warfare and weapons.\nAstropath Transcendent | Psyker of great power and capability.\nExplorator | Master of technology—ancient and new.\nMissionary | Bearer of the Emperor's Word, healer and leader.\nNavigator | Master of the Warp, guiding the vessels of the Imperium.\nSeneschal | Master of networks, cunning and wealth.\nVoid-master | Master of piloting and space warfare."

      "text": "RANKS\nEXAMPLE\nZinobi is a Rank 1 Void-master. He has spent 250 XP on various Advances from the Void-master's Rank 1 Advancement Scheme. He decides to spend another 250 XP from his starting XP allotment on an Advance from the Rank 2 Advancement Scheme. His GM informs him he cannot do this. Since Zinobi has not yet spent enough Experience Points to advance to Rank 2, he can only purchase Rank 1 Advances.\n\nPower and status within your Career Path is determined by the total amount of Experience Points your character has spent. The Advancement Scheme for each Rank in a character's Career Path shows which Advances are available to him at that Rank.\n\nAll characters start at Rank 1 within their Career Path, and all Characteristic Profile modifiers for that Rank are immediately applied to the character's stats, before any Experience Points are spent.\n\nYour character's Rank increases when his total spent Experience Points reaches a set amount. Each Career Path has unique Ranks, and each Rank has an Advancement Scheme which determines what amount of Experience Points (spent in total) a character must accumulate to gain that Rank.\n\nDependencies on other Career choices mean that a character might be eligible for more than one Rank at any given time; in this case, you must advance to the greater Rank. For example, the Seneschal would have far fewer Experience Points needed to meet the requirements attached to his Rank than a burly Arch-militant would. This will affect the variety and cost of Skills and Talents available to a character at each point in his progression.\n\nGaining Ranks with Prerequisites\nCharacters automatically gain Ranks once they reach a listed prerequisite total of spent XP. Once a character's total spent Experience Points reach this amount, determine your character's new Rank.\n\nNote that Rank Advances from a particular Rank require a character to have met all the listed prerequisites (Career, career Rank, Skill, Characteristic, or Talent) before purchasing such an Advance. If you are in doubt as to whether you meet the prerequisites for any given career or advancement chart, ask your GM, as he/she will decide which options are available.\n\nBUYING AN ADVANCE\nPurchasing an Advance is simple. Once you have had a look at the Advancement Scheme and chosen what you want to buy, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check with the GM that the Advance you want is available (the GM may restrict certain Skills and Talents based on the needs of the campaign or might require a logical in-game justification before purchase).\n\n2. Deduct the Experience Points cost of the Advance from your total Experience Points.\n\n3. Record the Advance in the appropriate section of your character sheet.\n\n4. Apply any Characteristic, Skill, or Talent bonuses or Traits that the Advance provides.\n\n5. Finally, add the newly spent XP to your Total Spent Experience Points to track your Rank.\n\nTABLE 2-2: RANKS\nRank | Spent Experience Points\n-----|------------------------\n1 | 0-4,999 XP\n2 | 5,000-9,999 XP\n3 | 10,000-14,999 XP\n4 | 15,000-19,999 XP\n5 | 20,000-24,999 XP\n6 | 25,000-29,999 XP\n7 | 30,000-39,999 XP\n8 | 40,000+ XP\n\nCertain Advances have a multiplier listed after their name. Advances with a multiplier may be purchased multiple times. In most cases, the multiplier's number indicates how many times that Rank's Experience Point cost must be paid to gain the Advance."

      "text": "DECIDING HOW TO ADVANCE YOUR CHARACTER\nYou should think carefully before deciding which Advances you should take first, as some have wide-ranging side effects on your character's ability to perform in certain areas. Whilst Characteristic Advances do provide the most points for your characters, Skills and Talents often unlock a multitude of new opportunities and will need to be considered when deciding on how to improve your character. For instance, spending Experience Points to gain a Skill might be an easy way to quickly improve an Explorer's chances at success for a particular activity, while a new Talent which costs 200 XP might in fact be the better purchase over time.\n\nWhenever you're planning your Advances, you might want to follow a few simple guidelines:\n• Pick a specific specialty well, and focus on certain Skills and Talents.\n• Improve a particularly important Characteristic quickly (to at least +10).\n• Consider acquiring a new Talent which costs 200 XP over a Skill Advance which costs 100 XP, after you've trained together a few key Skills you consider mission-essential.\n• If you simply aren't sure which would be a better Advance, simply purchase both.\n\nCREATING YOUR OWN CAREER PATHS\nWhilst the Career Paths detailed here serve specific and heroic concepts designed for exploring new sectors, campaigns often veer into strange directions. Some players may find it fun to develop a new Career Path option not provided here, possibly to suit a successful NPC or roleplay well within a certain niche.\n\nWhen planning your new Career Path, you might want to use one existing tree as a reference, then closely examine certain trades or niches to see where they might fit. For example, a player creating an alien race Arch-militant who has left Port Wander to secure his fate aboard this vessel, or a renowned Rogue Trader or bodyguard companion for one of the player's Explorers, whose background and present position is whatever you prefer it to be. Under the auspices of playing again, you need to help fleshing out your character's background and beliefs for some time until you can give your GM a sufficient hook he can use with your history.\n\nCOMPLETING ALL THE RANKS\nWith the combination of skill, audacity, and sheer luck characteristic of the most successful followers of the Omnissiah, however, the Advancements listed are not limited to those available to a character progressing through the Career Path. Players are encouraged to continue spending Experience Points on different Advances during play. For example, once a character has attained the Top Rank in his Career Path and is considered to have completed his Career, the character is permitted to branch out and pursue a new path. Career Paths in ROGUE TRADER can lead into other trees once certain conditions are met. These might be normative promotions or a significant amount of roleplaying, with training for specific Skills or a Talent acquired along the way. For example, Explorers might become so well-versed in tech-rites that they learn the Trade (Chymist) Skill.\n\nThe base cost for such an Advance depends on which sphere the character's career belongs in and where the character's new studies direct him. Normally, acquiring a Skill outside one's Career Path costs between 300 and 600 Experience Points, but the GM may require a higher Experience Point cost than you had anticipated, or may require you to first acquire various Skills or Talents. Of course, your GM may also rule that you do not have the necessary prerequisites required to gain the Advance (such as Skill or Talent). This will usually indicate he feels the Quest for this skill is worth the time to research, train, and learn.\n\nFor example, making a successful petition to a merchant guild who might teach the Trade (Miner) Skill might take a great deal of time, effort, and preparations. For this reason, your GM may decide to grant you the Elite Advance as a reward for completing a successful adventure. Or alternatively, the GM may determine that you have earned the Advance but require a higher Experience Point cost than you had estimated to acquire it. Of course, your GM may also rule that you do not have the necessary prerequisites required to gain the Advance. This will usually indicate he feels the quest for this additional training or trading guild is worth the time to research, train, and learn."

      "text": "ROGUE TRADER\n\"Half a dozen hatefuls have I slain, and a half again remains. Justice and truth for the loyal; banishment and death for the rest.\"\n—Ansellus Aquairre, Lord-Captain of the Corelis Imperial\n\nA sacred Warrant of Trade empowers him to go boldly beyond the boundaries of the Imperium, to explore and exploit in the God-Emperor's name. The Rogue Trader embodies a unique grace in the grim darkness of the Imperium, a specially granted power to rise above the rigid hierarchy of nobles and petty bureaucrats driving into the unknown where fortune and glory await.\n\nThe Rogue Trader is a master of his fate, central to his own legend, and his skill at force and sharpness of wit can turn enemies to allies, and allies to enemies. Whether cunning, daring, or brutal, every Rogue Trader embodies ambition unrestrained.\n\nFollowing in the steps upon which he has lived his life, the Rogue Trader soars into the fields where battles rage and forgotten archeotech waits for recovery. Often Rogue Traders come from dynasties that were established (or darkly infamous) for millennia. Other times they are from newer, more dynamic families, often coming from the ranks of the Adeptus, the Imperial Navy, the Merchant Guard, or other callings that have proven their skills.\n\nThe Imperium is first and foremost a military fate. First contacts between Rogue Traders and their foes are almost always violent, and even amongst those who consider themselves allies, conflicts are never far from the surface. As a result, all of the most successful Rogue Traders have a finely ingrained sense of military awareness, tactical acumen and a full knowledge of personal arms and martial prowess. Though their ranks may include the most specialized of skills or function, there's no Rogue Trader who would refuse to learn how to defend himself. The measure of what they must control can span the far reaches of space.\n\nWhile most Rogue Traders have formal training in strategic command and a conceptual understanding of personal combat tactics, they are most noted for their charisma and leadership abilities. These are what permit a Rogue Trader to connect with the men serving under his command and to lead them to danger, to have them follow where no others would be willing to dare. Those who claim to follow a Rogue Trader out of misplaced sense of duty or loyalty often find bitter ends. Those who follow from personal ties have fared better, along with the Rogue Traders who reward the cunning and courageous. A Rogue Trader will give of his own royally to forward the ambitions of his loyal retinue.\n\nMost Rogue Traders are prudent and chose to acquire for themselves odd, archaic, or coveted wargear. Some refuse to set foot on the bridge without donning ancient and sought-after force field generators or alien-tech personal void shields, while others carry fiendishly cunning xenos digital weapons or elegant, well-crafted implements of destruction.\n\nHowever they are outwardly equipped, Rogue Traders are supremely confident, and always know when to deploy even the most mundane of weapons to maximum effect. They have profited from their perilous paths across the stars and learned merely to survive means to profit."

      "text": "ARCH-MILITANT\n\"The mind is a muscle that must be trained, the warrior's fist is his brain, and the gun his tongue.\"\n—Fellmann, Lord-Militant, Battlegroup Thetas\n\nWar—endless and total—is the inescapable and iron-clad fate into which every human being is born. From lowliest hive-serf to the highest scion, all mankind exists to fight and to die in uncounted billions for causes remote and intangible. Many fall and countless lives are needlessly sacrificed, yet to die in war is not a death sentence but rather a blessing. Such men and women—the soldiers called Arch-militants—know this with brutal honesty. And all who benefit from Mankind's dominance owe the Arch-militant a debt of gratitude.\n\nMany Imperial Guard veterans have survived against impossible odds, often the last survivors of their entire regiments. Others have risen from the murderous societies of feral death worlds, or clawed their way out of the catastrophic fighting pits of hive worlds where only a handful of warriors will somehow prevail. These are the men and women who have broken the bodies of screaming mutants, who have dug themselves out from beneath mounds of corpses to fight again. They are warriors who never surrender, no matter how terrible the odds stacked against them. They take the bullets when all others fail to do so, buying their companions time through sheer bravery, or simply taken luck.\n\nWithout exception, experienced individuals such as these command invaluable skills. Their unspoken or near-psychic intuition, those detached and deadly foes while they themselves seem to disappear into the background, makes them powerful allies. The personal staff of Arch-militant Lord Militants is unquestionably formidable. Influential Rogue Traders seeking their own personal champion often boast that their Arch-militants walk untouched through the hail of bullets, each has supreme martial ability regardless of the theater of war. All Arch-militants succeed where others fail: they have marked the way through unholy labor with the potentiality of any foe they might face.\n\nMeaning through their actions, not their mere words, Arch-militants overcome seemingly hopeless situations by a combination of cold logic, fierce personal honor, and a direct, no-nonsense attitude. Out beyond the edge of space, men and women fitted with skills and abilities are indeed special, and few Rogue Traders would pass upon adding a word-bearer to their retinue if at all possible.\n\nIn a galaxy beset by constant war, the Arch-militant is a weapon of war without equal, just as surely as the company's finest plasma cannon or power sword."

      "text": "ASTROPATH TRANSCENDENT\n\"Who am I? Merely the messenger. You are of no import if this message is not received.\"\n—Andrex Vulchis, Astropath Transcendent\n\nPsychic individuals are those whose minds possesses a connection to the Immaterium, and whose link to the realm of Chaos allows them to reach into limitless gulfs and mould raw energy to their will. Their souls are armoured against the wailing tides of the warp, but all too often this armour is thin. Throughout the vast breadth of the Imperium, uncounted millions of psykers are born every day, and with each step they make their star holds inexorably falling prey to the predators with each step they make. The fate of the majority of the psykers born amongst mankind is a short, grim one, but they are necessary so that the Imperium might be held together.\n\nA select fraction, judged strong enough to serve the Imperium, are tested by Inquisitor and Space Marine Librarian alike. Those chosen to become Astropaths undergo the ritual known as Soul-Binding, which shields them from the horrors of the Warp. According to the Imperial records, this takes place on Terra, in the shadowy depths of the Emperor's Palace. There, they undergo a ritual that will irrevocably change their mind and bind them closer to the Emperor. During this ritual, the psychic might of the Emperor sears their very souls, cleaning them with holy fire. The experience is invariably traumatic, leaving their organs either totally destroyed or completely ravaged, leaving them blind and experiencing suffering unknown to their former kin. This ordeal often results in the incurring loss of smell, taste, touch or hearing.\n\nRelying on the Imperium's efforts and the mind of warfare troop communication, it has a great demand for Astropaths, and such is the greatest path for a psyker who wishes to survive. Soul-Binding is more than a sacrifice—it is a direct connection to the Emperor's might, adding to the psychic potency of the entire choir of Astropaths, allowing their thoughts vast networks that cover entire planets light years distant.\n\nAn Astropath Transcendent is indeed one who rises beyond his given duties and responsibilities in the ranks of the psychic choir. Of those placed in charge of Astropathic facilities or Warp-diving chambers, some few go on to become the most powerful officials of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica itself. Of all the telepaths, mind-witches and Warp-wizards within the Imperium, those who service a Rogue Trader's needs are exposed to the very fringe of the Emperor's Domain.\n\nAn Astropath Transcendent is a scholar-priest, both the holder and the wielded blade. Amongst their kind, they are revered and feared, and what they deserve as their thoughts ranges from the black gulfs of space while others cast themselves increasingly alone into the feared corners of their fellows. Into the cellar of chance and fate, they endure challenges both grounded and feared. \"I am the foul will of Astropaths,\" many claim, knowing the essential role performed by the greater psychic choir of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. Many Rogue Traders employ relatively little more than a handful of Astropaths. Perhaps only one being in a position of great responsibility, they provide the only means of viable communication between widely scattered Imperial worlds and vessels. Many Mechanicus Explorator expeditions even consider numerous if not superfluous an Astropath Transcendent by their side."

      "text": "EXPLORATOR\n\"Omnissiah guide our steps and clear our minds. Only through logic and reason can we achieve victory over the darkness. The void calls, and the Machine God beckons.\"\n—Tech-Priest Explorator Enginseer Heymeyer\n\nThe Machine Cult of Mars maintains its functionaries throughout the domains of the Imperium. From the Cult Mechanicus, they are seen as expressions of their ideals, testing the Omnissiah by exploring into the vastness of space. Within the Machine God's light, the Explorator searches for archaeotech components and mechanisms that might propel Mankind into a fusion with the sacred Omnissiah. Even more importantly, they may discover lost pieces of Dark Age Technology that, in Mechanicus hands, could spell doom for an entire region. Kill them!\n\nThese are the intrepid (or foolhardy) individuals who undertake journeys that might mean their death or salvation. Within the Omnissiah's sight, they painstakingly piece together how things were being done previously, attempting improvisations that could reach dizzying heights again as followers of the Omnissiah learn the Knowledge of the Ancients without risking their deadly sins and the dark fate that befalls them.\n\nPure folly would be to abandon completely or even partially the rigid doctrine of the Machine God. It might be a surprising thought that adherents of mechanical processes and cold analysis can become corrupted by personal ambitions. Those who explore know they are in thrall to the Quest for Knowledge, even if their adventure takes them far from the bastions of the Mechanicus. All Explorator devices are driven by curiosity, and on particularly rare occasions their inquisitive honors exceed the narrow mandate of Mankind's welfare.\n\nWhen exploring, Explorators come about by various ancient debts the Rogue Trader might owed the Cult Mechanicus from beginnings centuries past. The Explorator, being a well-educated member of the Trader dynasty with current knowledge and \"ancient\" technical know-how beyond any other member of the crew and often utilizing the raw power of his own engineered augmetics, is a truly unique resource a Rogue Trader would find to be of great worth."

      "text": "MISSIONARY\n\"Holy Terra absolves your sins. The God-Emperor Himself shakes your shackles free. Do not doubt the path spread before you.\"\n—Saint Sinclair, Talloian Expansionist\n\nRegardless of local idiosyncrasies, holy edicts, and disagreements, there is one faith that dominates all worlds throughout the Imperium: the worship of the God-Emperor of Mankind. The Ecclesiarchy exists to foster, enforce, and impose faith across the million worlds of the Imperium and those many frontier worlds where Man's light still burns. It is the light of faith—to bring the word of the Imperial Truth to benighted humanity. The light of kind Man's faith is unshakeable.\n\nThe Missionary is somewhat unusual compared to most citizens. Part warrior, part politician, and part executioner, they are more than a walking temple clothed in the trappings of his calling. Whether it's by holy warp bolt or passionate oratory, they aspire to spread the teachings of the Ecclesiarchy across the Emperor's domains, burning heretics and locating lost human worlds for absorption into the Imperial fold.\n\nMissionaries are commonly dispatched alongside Rogue Trader vessels that venture beyond Imperial space to recover surrounded communities of an ancient human heritage and bring back those who stray from the faith. However, only the best of the Ecclesiarchy's officers are intellectually and doctrinally thinking as the average Missionary must be prepared to confront many forms of worship that would be considered heretical by most of their compatriots. Even the most doctrinaire find it easier to stand silent at a time when assimilation and accommodation of local faiths practiced by the forlorn souls they encounter serves the greater good.\n\nRarely would a Missionary take false umbrage where none was meant; instead, through skills and diplomacy, they seek out parallels between the various deities worshipped and Imperial Saints. With subtle and often Machiavellian methods, the Missionary creates a gradual process whereby colonies worshipping what appears to be an angry sun-god come to realize they are actually worshipping the Emperor and that the venerating beast-god to which they offer their firstborn is actually the Emperor's holy foes.\n\nThe true skill resides in knowing when their racial tactics and methods are likely to prove fruitless and when something else more direct is the only solution. Through his patience and talent, the Missionary may often convince the Rogue Trader that these lost brethren need not be exterminated or blasted from orbit for the good of all Mankind, seeing instead a golden opportunity for conversion.\n\nSome Missionaries go beyond the common organization; only a fool would willingly stop a Missionary in addition to their task of converting the lost. Missionaries often find themselves acting as spiritual figure heads to the vessel they accompany. The political and religious wealth and influence this affords them sometimes confuses some amongst other organizations who come to misread their commands."

      "text": "SENESCHAL\n\"Every whisper and overheard conversation is of interest to a Seneschal.\"\n—Lord-Captain Fiilak D. D'Kross\n\nQuietly, efficiently, and confidently, the Seneschal moves through a Rogue Trader's world, amassing and collating endless streams of data. From whispers at grand diplomatic functions to the crude hand-language of half-feral voidmen, all communications are noted, cross-referenced and collated with suspicious speed. All those whom the Seneschal counts as not-enemies share their secrets with him, whether the subjects realize it or not.\n\nThe Seneschal is a noble's or Rogue Trader's confidant, personal assistant, and sometimes, conscience. For every Rogue Trader blasting through the unvisited reaches of the void, there is a Seneschal counting the number of bolter shells fired, measuring out the oxygen, and matching names with faces. While some Arch-militants or Navigators might grow weary of the endless calculations that a Seneschal ponders obsessively at all hours, they respect his subtlety and the ability to part a fool from his fortune.\n\nIt was not always so. The Seneschal was once a position much looked down upon, and even now, Rogue Traders often refer to their Seneschals as \"my man.\" The Seneschal is the friend who stands in the background, noting how often a visiting noble lord refills his wine glass, or chatting amicably with an enemy warrior's personal guard.\n\nExperienced Seneschals, those who continue in service to a Rogue Trader House for long periods, are often nearly as wealthy as their lord's family. Though many never gain the respect granted their post, other retinues are managed to such nuance and subtle degree by the Seneschal that they take the post for themselves when their master perishes.\n\nThe Seneschal always has a purpose; his network of contacts and spies reaches across the void. Every detail that might affect business is of interest. Seneschals will remember and note something they consider trivial until the moment it becomes essential. Every Seneschal, whether scanner-thrall raised duty-bound from a noble House or a guttersnipe fallen into the big money of a Rogue Trader, is a consummate professional. Most can tell instinctively whether a deal will end in tears simply by observing who is sitting with whom at the negotiating table.\n\nCunning, quick-witted, and utterly deadly when the situation demands, the Seneschal is a foe to be feared. Many have learned (often to their cost) how to move through the background and observe events whilst remaining unobserved themselves. Witness a Seneschal at work behind the scenes pulling strings, and the truth becomes clear; called controller, profit-monger, and spy, the Seneschal is quite simply the real power behind any Rogue Trader's throne."

      "text": "VOID-MASTER\n\"Look down from the bridge of a ship. Here I am, higher than a mountain peak, born to command.\"\n—Senior Ship's Master Toral Fang\n\nWhile most Rogue Traders have little more than a passing familiarity with the mysterious arts of piloting a void-faring vessel, a Void-master knows every inch of his vessel and even the cold touch of the airless void presents little fear, for he has entered the void countless times and has lived to tell the tales. A Void-master knows when his masters and crew have crossed the line into the truly dangerous reaches of space. Whether it's a fighter pilot or commander of the vessel, a Void-master is exceptional even among his skilled brethren.\n\nVoid-masters are a rare breed, possessing both tremendous talent and ability. Regardless of their background, whether their origins be bilge-scum or scion of a lauded Navigator House with a title, a Void-master must have what it takes to hold the void in his hands. They might be a helmsman, fighter pilot, or gun captain—whatever their specialty, the vessel they control is an extension of their own body and the ship's survival depends on them. Where most within the Imperium might view space travel with ignorance and superstition, the people they encounter such as the Void-master quite often are equally skilled, learned, and entirely rational. Rather than confine themselves to worlds below, they hurl themselves into the endless void, endlessly trudging through ship's corridors.\n\nMany Void-masters picked up their skills in other factions throughout the Imperium. Some trained within the fighting forces of the Imperial Navy, while others spent time on pirate vessels or privateer craft. Frequently, these individuals have been recognized and they have been allowed access through the ranks of their particular organizations, gaining a broad range of skills from the countless dangers they have faced.\n\nThe Imperium is an interstellar empire spanning much of the galaxy. It contains over a million worlds and countless souls beyond counting. Its vast fleets of military, merchant, and exploratory spacecraft knit the realm together and some of the most essential individuals are those who spend their whole lives protected by armored bulkheads.\n\nThrough innate talent, countless hours of study, and grim experience, the Void-master has risen above the average voidfarer—doing what most would consider the impossible. The Rogue Traders' Guide to the voids would surely include tales of wily Void-masters who elude the Emperor's tithes and wreak mischief among the shipping lanes."

      "text": "SPECIAL ABILITIES\nEXPLORATOR SPECIAL ABILITY\nAll of the Careers in ROGUE TRADER also possess unique special abilities that help define them and grant them an edge when adventuring.\n\nExplorator Implants: Explorators begin play with Common-Craftsmanship Mechadendrite implants (see Page 147). They may spend 200 XP to either increase the Craftsmanship of one implant by one level, or acquire one additional Common-Craftsmanship Mechadendrite of their choice.\n\nROGUE TRADER SPECIAL ABILITY\nMaster and Commander: The Rogue Trader adds his Fellowship Bonus to Command Tests when commanding the crew aboard his vessel. Additionally, the Rogue Trader may re-roll failed Command Tests when dealing with the crew of his ship, but must accept the second result even if it is worse.\n\nARCH-MILITANT SPECIAL ABILITY\nKnown Only In Death: When an Arch-militant achieves a Rank 2 or higher, he gains a +10 bonus to hit and +2 to damage with one type of weapon of his chosen speciality. This bonus stacks with any relevant Combat or Weapon Training Talents.\n\nMISSIONARY SPECIAL ABILITY\nPure Faith: The Missionary begins play with the Pure Faith Talent (see page 104).\n\nNAVIGATOR SPECIAL ABILITIES\nEye of the Navigator: Navigators begin play with the Third Eye Special Trait and may select one starting Navigator Power.\n\nCHANGING NAVIGATOR POWERS\nJust like the Navigator develops, he may change his powers. As the Navigator character gains experience, he may purchase Navigator Powers (much like Talents). Whenever his Willpower increases by +5, he may exchange one Navigator Power for another by making a successful opposed Willpower Test against a difficulty of 20 plus his Perception Bonus. Failure means the Navigator cannot trade powers again until his Willpower increases again.\n\nASTROPATH TRANSCENDENT SPECIAL ABILITIES\nSoul-Bound to the Emperor: Astropath Transcendents are soul-bound to the Emperor through a mystical ritual that grants them complete immunity to Perils of the Warp when generating psychic powers. This special ability does not protect the Astropath from the normal consequences of failing a psychic power Test; however, it does completely shield the psyker from all random psychic phenomena, including Perils of the Warp.\n\nAstropath Transcendents begin play with two psychic techniques from the Telepathic discipline. See Chapter VI: Psychic Powers for details of each of these techniques. An Astropath Transcendent begins with the Astral Telepathy and Sending techniques from the Telepathic Discipline (see page 162), and an additional technique from the Telepathic Discipline.\n\nSENESCHAL SPECIAL ABILITY\nMaster of Trade: The Seneschal may re-roll a failed Fellowship Test once per day when dealing with any Commerce actions. The Seneschal automatically gains any Cipher Skills that would be required to obtain resources (including without limitation Rogue Trader, High Gothic, the Underworld) when making an Acquisition Test. In addition the Seneschal adds one point to the group's Profit Factor.\n\nVOID-MASTER SPECIAL ABILITY\nOne with the Void: The Void-Master begins play with one of the following abilities:\nMastery of Gunnery: The Void-Master gets a +10 bonus to all Ballistic Skill Tests with Shooting Actions (see page 218) aboard a starship.\nMastery of Helm: The Void-Master gets a +10 bonus to all Pilot Tests with Manoeuvre Actions (see page 217) aboard a space ship.\nMastery of Small Craft: The Void-Master gets a +10 bonus to all Pilot Tests with small craft (flyers, shuttles, etc.)."

      "text": "CHAPTER III:\nSKILLS\n\"Bullets find fanatics and the foolish. So think. Learn. Grow wiser. Only the ignorant truly rush into battle.\"\n—Lieutenant Malcer, Imperial Guard\n\nSkills in ROGUE TRADER represent knowledge and training that an Explorer has acquired, and act as the fundamental means by which characters overcome challenges and obstacles. When testing a skill, the player must roll against the Characteristic governing that skill. Success means the Explorer has performed the test adequately, although the more degrees of success achieved, the better the result. When choosing which Skills an Explorer should have, Skills are divided into different categories.\n\nWithin these categories you'll find a wide variety of basic and advanced skills, many of which a character might use during the course of an adventure. This chapter contains detailed explanations of each skill category as well as what a certain increase in his chance of success means for an Explorer.\n\nMore information about making Skill Tests can be found in Chapter IX: Playing the Game.\n\nGAINING SKILLS\nBASIC SKILLS\nBasic Skills are techniques and knowledge commonly found throughout the Imperium. Basic Skills can be attempted by any Explorer, even if he does not have the skill trained. When a character uses an untrained Basic Skill, he halves his governing Characteristic.\n\nWhen a character has a Basic Skill trained, he uses his full governing Characteristic for Tests with this skill. All newly created Explorers begin with a set of starting skills determined by their Home World and chosen Career Path. These skills represent what the Explorers know before starting their current exploits, and do not cost any Experience Points to gain.\n\nADVANCED SKILLS\nAdvanced Skills require specialist knowledge, and training or education. Advanced Skills cannot be attempted untrained. Characters acquire Advanced Skills during their careers, as determined by their Career Path choices. Unlike Basic Skills, Advanced Skills cannot be used untrained regardless of circumstances.\n\nTRAINING AND SKILL MASTERY\nWhenever an Explorer acquires a skill, he is effectively trained in that skill and can use it without penalty. Sometimes an Explorer will have the opportunity to acquire the same skill more than once. When an Explorer acquires a skill for a second time, his Skill Mastery Bonus increases to +10. When he acquires that same skill a third time, his Skill Mastery Bonus increases to +20.\n\nTREATING ADVANCED SKILLS AS BASIC SKILLS\nSometimes an Explorer might be required to use an Advanced Skill without having acquired the necessary training, possibly because of unusual circumstances. In such cases, the GM might allow an Explorer to attempt an Advanced Skill Test at half of the skill's governing Characteristic, as if it were a Basic Skill. Note there is a difference between treating an Advanced Skill as a Basic Skill (reducing the governing Characteristic by half) and actually having the Advanced Skill trained—even at the most rudimentary level."

      "text": "SKILL DESCRIPTORS\nSome skills fall broadly into categories as defined by the GM in accordance with the encounter. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more information on NPC disposition.\n\nThese descriptors allow both players and GMs to gain appropriate skill solutions from characters.\n\nINVESTIGATION SKILLS\nMost of the skills with Investigation descriptor allow Explorers to collect information from various sources. They require knowledge as the Explorer hunts for clues, sifts through cogitator records, or conducts extensive research.\n\nCRAFTING SKILLS\nGiven the proper time and tools, skills with the Crafting descriptor allow a character to make things from materials at hand. It is far more complex to create the writings of a xenos philosopher than a multi-key or the lock of a local crime lord. In such cases, the GM might combine the proper Skills or request several tests based on the quality/quantity of the item desired. The quality of the finished product improves with more degrees of success. Failing by one or more degrees may destroy or damage the item in the process.\n\nMOVEMENT SKILLS\nA skill with a Movement descriptor increases the ability of the Explorer to move, whether from turning a corner at high speeds, navigating across a chasm, or climbing out of a mine - if he doesn't quite make it across, movement penalties applying according to the environment through which the Explorer is moving.\n\nEXPLORATION SKILLS\nSkills with the Exploration descriptor are often used together in Exploration Challenges. These challenges are rarely as humble as Hive pickpocketing, requiring a team approach with each Explorer contributing according to their particular experience and knowledge base.\n\nOPERATOR SKILLS\nAny skill that involves transportation of a vehicle, spacecraft, or military starship carries the Operator descriptor. These skills allow the Explorer to drive, pilot, or maneuver larger vehicles. More information on Exploration Challenges can be found in Chapter IX: Playing the Game.\n\nINTERACTION SKILLS\nAll skills with the Interaction descriptor imply interplay with others. As a rule, Interaction Skills usually involve Opposed Tests with the NPC, and the GM determines the individual's disposition towards the Explorer. When meeting characters for the first time, the GM usually begins with an Interaction Test to understand the NPCs reactions and to better describe the initial link between Explorer and non-player character.\n\nSKILL GROUPS\nSome skills encompass groups of related skills. For brevity's sake, skill groups are listed together, but each must be acquired and used separately. For example, Pilot (Flyers) and Pilot (Space Craft) are distinct skills and having training in one does not grant training in the other."

      "text": "SKILL DESCRIPTIONS\nThe following are the descriptions for all Skills, both Basic and Advanced, in Rogue Trader.\n\nBARTER (BASIC, INTERACTION)\nFellowship\nBarter allows the Explorer to negotiate prices and exchange goods with people. If the Explorer wants to negotiate the Acquisition Modifier for items where the price is not set, he makes a Barter Test. The Explorer can also change the Acquisition Modifier, attempting to improve a high modifier by making a Barter Test. The Explorer's Fellowship Bonus and degrees of success or failure affect the result according to the profile of the merchant promoting an Imperial guard with double-barreled shotguns. All Barter Tests are Opposed Tests in that they involve interaction by their very nature.\n\nWhen making an Acquisition Test (see page 271), the Explorer can make a Barter Test to improve his chances when engaged in delicate dealings and intricate negotiations. When like trades with like, it might involve extremely complex bartering; success obtains the best of the deal while failure indicates that the Explorer got a bad trade.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action unless otherwise noted.\n\nACROBATICS (ADVANCED, MOVEMENT)\nAgility\nAcrobatics represents the Explorer's ability to perform feats of athletic prowess not even common folk would attempt. Simply running within a gravity field, leaping with chains attached, dodging space debris, and even simple tumbling are accomplished with an Acrobatics Test. While using this skill in the vacuum between worlds might seem impossible, microgravity and inertial compensators turn almost any stable surface into a tumbling challenge.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action.\n\nSpecial Use: Jump\nAn Acrobatics Test may substitute for an Agility Test when jumping. The character must roll against this characteristic according to the appropriate rule on page 260.\n\nAWARENESS (BASIC, EXPLORATION)\nPerception\nThe Explorer uses this Skill to notice threats, ambushes, and hidden objects such as secret doors or hiding persons. Successful Tests mean the character has noticed something out of the ordinary, while those across from him are making Concealment or Silent Move Opposed Tests. The Talent group includes Heightened Senses or something technological that would otherwise either from a natural effect of age, or something unnatural that shrouds a room from inquiry.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action unleash otherwise noted.\n\nSpecial Use: Eavesdropping\nAwareness Tests allow the Explorer to hear and determine a conversation at a distance. Failure indicates the Explorer could not hear the conversation clearly.\n\nBLATHER (ADVANCED, INTERACTION)\nFellowship\nBlather allows an Explorer to confuse a person with a continuous stream of nonsense, bewildering babble, meaningless expressions, irrelevant factoids, or just generally mindless chatter that invites no reply. Blather Tests are always Opposed Willpower Tests. Success means the opponent stands confused for his entire next turn, winning the Opposed Test results in the opponent's bemused inaction for his entire next turn. For example, the Explorer would add his Fellowship Bonus to the Opposed Test.\n\nSpecial Use: Disengage\nWhen using the Disengage Action in combat, the Explorer may Blather against an opponent instead of an Agility Test. If the Explorer uses Blather, he adds his Fellowship Bonus to the Opposed Test.\n\nGroup Blather\nA character may attempt to Blather against a group. When using Blather against similar Characteristics, the GM may roll a single Willpower Test for the entire group while the Explorer makes his Test. While the mob may be confused by his words and talents (or their drinking), the fact is they are dangerous to remain near. The character who initiates a Test fails should be prepared to face the imminent pain that follows.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action.\n\nCAROUSE (BASIC)\nToughness\nThe Carouse Skill tests the character's resistance to the effects of alcohol and other intoxicating substances, remaining clear-headed as those around them pass out drunk. The character must make a Carouse Test when consuming alcohol, toxic chemicals, or alien deviances that might otherwise affect his physiology. Success in a Carouse Test means the Explorer has successfully mustered his resistance and does not suffer ill effects of the substance. Failure indicates he has failed to resist and suffers the full effects.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action unless otherwise noted."

      "text": "CHARM (BASIC, INTERACTION)\nFellowship\nAn Explorer uses the Charm Skill to improve the disposition of another. Charm represents a pleasant manner, flattery, and plain charm that makes people want to speak about something, quite simply. Charm Tests are always Opposed Tests because they involve convincing a being to affect his emotional state towards the Explorer. Charm Tests affect only a single target. The GM will determine the target's disposition after a successful (or unsuccessful) Charm Test.\n\nSkill Use: Variable based on circumstance (includes Free Action).\n\nSpecial Use: Inspire\nCharm can be substituted with a Difficult (+0) Test to inspire troops before a pitched battle, improve morale aboard ship, or otherwise incite a group to positive action. When used to improve morale, it provides a +10 bonus to a group for a relevant Skill Test.\n\nSee Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more information on Interaction Tests or the Leadership action (page 216).\n\nCHEM-USE (ADVANCED, INVESTIGATION)\nIntelligence\nChem-Use allows the Explorer to identify and prepare chemical substances, including both natural and man-made compounds. While Chem-Use represents the use and combination of compounds, the Trade (Chymist) skill represents the manufacture of the base chemicals themselves. Using toxic chemicals requires care, and the Explorer's Chem-Use skill represents his knowledge of how to properly apply, dilute, and handle chemical components.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action unless otherwise noted.\n\nCIPHERS (ADVANCED)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Trader's Cant, Navis Nobilite, Rogue Trader, Astropath Sign, and Underworld.\n\nMany organizations employ ciphers to securely communicate basic ideas. Using ciphers to communicate information is pointless unless the cipher is required to meet obscure counterintelligence laws. The Explorer can read and understand the following ciphers:\n\nTrader's Cant: Mercantile interests across the Imperium have developed their own special dialect for coordinating supply lines, exchanging information about prices, qualities, coordinates and hard-to-match icons from other merchants. The Imperium contains so many merchant guilds, cartels, and hardy independent merchants that most of it speaks in its own commercial dialect.\n\nRogue Trader: Warrant bearers employ a unique form of notation replete with signet impressions, coordinates, markers, Seneschal notes, icons, and more. This includes the authorized House-speak of old families, from the Angevin, Winterscale, Haarlock, or Marchenko dynasties to the newest wave of explorers passing through Port Wander.\n\nNavis Nobilite Encoding: The secretive families of the Navigators maintain their own histories stretching back millennia and have evolved mysterious guarded languages, dialects, and modes of communication. Each family has its own unique way to maintain the secrets of their history and caste. This language can contain coded references mixed in with seemingly random impressions and non-sequiturs, including whispers of the blind and multi-spectral emanations not normally detectable.\n\nAstropath Sign: Crime lords have developed efficient coded languages to maintain secrecy and elude authorities. Each sector contains its own collection of cant (or mystical slang), only vaguely similar to the common merchant dialect. Thieves and pirates employ such codes to maintain secrecy in the years-long delays in Imperial communications.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action.\n\nCLIMB (BASIC, MOVEMENT)\nStrength\nThe Explorer may climb or descend most surfaces including pipelines, escarpments, both natural and man-made walls. This skill is not needed when dealing with a wall that features handholds, but for climbs that lack natural hand- or foothold, or present other poor climbing conditions. Climbing is modified by gravity and the environment. Difficult conditions impose additional bonuses or penalties as needed; a rockface on a feral world differs from a ship's bulkhead encrusted with pipes and coolant lines.\n\nA successful Climb Test result allows one-half or half movement rate. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more details.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nCOMMAND (BASIC)\nFellowship\nExplorer utilizes the Command skill to motivate those under his authority and establish his right of rulership. This skill is only effective upon those under the Explorer's authority or those who choose to follow his instructions. Failed Command Tests imply that the Explorer does not get his point across or the subject refuses to follow his command.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action for simple commands; Full Action for complex or multi-stage commands requiring extension instructions."

      "text": "COMMERCE (ADVANCED)\nFellowship\nThe Explorer uses Commerce when involved in business enterprise. They make Opposed Tests in trade negotiations against the other party's Commerce Skill, with various modifiers depending on circumstances. Commerce Tests are a significant part of a Seneschal's Skill set, as he is typically the main skill used in utilizing the Explorer's Profit Factor when making Acquisitions (see page 271).\n\nCommerce Skill Tests can assist in recalling details about trade agreements, commercial ventures, and trading partners throughout the Imperium.\n\nSkill Use: Variable.\n\nCOMMON LORE (ADVANCED, INVESTIGATION)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Adeptus Astra Telepathica, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Creed, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Imperium, Koronus Expanse, Navis Nobilite, Pirates, Rogue Traders, Tech, War, and Void.\n\nCommon Lore allows the Explorer to recall a variety of information. Common Lore differs from Scholastic Lore, which represents formal study; and Forbidden Lore, which involves hidden or proscribed knowledge. Common Lore deals with basic information about the Imperium, generally gained through simple exposure or general education.\n\nThe GM determines what the Explorer knows based on his knowledge of the subject. Additional Degrees of Success represent additional knowledge of the areas as listed below:\n\nAdeptus Astra Telepathica: Knowledge of Astropaths including their training and means of sending and receiving telepathic messages.\n\nAdeptus Mechanicus: Understanding of the basic practices, canticles, and followers of the Machine God, including some familiarity with their hierarchy, identification and purpose.\n\nAdministratum: Knowledge of the basic functions, appearance, hierarchy, and familiar departments of the Adeptus Administratum.\n\nEcclesiarchy: Understanding the Adeptus Ministorum, including the clergy, famous clerics, equipment associated with the Church of the Emperor.\n\nImperial Creed: Knowledge of the practices of the pilgrims of the God-Emperor of Man, the Imperial Cult that governs the construction of temples, the rituals for daily prayer, the proper punishments for the heretic, and the unshakable faith of humanity.\n\nImperial Guard: Knowledge of the largest military force in the galaxy, including rank insignia, regiments, and famous campaigns.\n\nImperial Navy: Knowledge of the functioning of the Imperial Navy, including basic knowledge of Imperial ships of war and battlefleets.\n\nImperium: Knowledge of the million worlds of the Imperium and the basic tenets of Imperial rule.\n\nKoronus Expanse: Information concerning the Koronus Expanse including basic knowledge of celestial phenomena, worlds, and voidfaring concerns in the Expanse.\n\nNavis Nobilite: Knowledge of the selection and training of the Navigator families and their place in the Imperial hierarchy.\n\nPirates: Knowledge of famous pirates and corsairs, their methods and territories, and how to avoid their attention.\n\nRogue Traders: Lore of the warrants of trade, their variety, extent, and the corresponding authority granted to a Rogue Trader.\n\nTech: Understanding of the simple rituals, machine spirits, and basic applications of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the technology they maintain.\n\nWar: Knowledge of great battles, tactics commanders, heretics, and the tides of war that sweep the Imperium.\n\nVoid: Knowledge of space; astral phenomenon, the basics of space travel, and survival in the void.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action.\n\nCONCEALMENT (BASIC)\nAgility\nConcealment is the Skill to hide an item or a person in an appropriate environment. For example, the character could conceal a weapon within his clothing, or hide himself behind a bulkhead aboard a ship or amongst rocks in an asteroid field or space hulk.\n\nConcealment Skill Tests are Opposed Tests against the opponent's Search or Awareness Skill, depending on whether the item has been deliberately hidden. The Concealment Test indicates the Explorer's success at hiding the item or object. Being observed while concealing an object applies a penalty to the Skill Test. The GM may modify the Difficulty of the Test according to the environment.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nCONTORTIONIST (BASIC, COMBAT)\nAgility\nExplorers with the Contortionist Skill can bend their bodies in unusual ways, slip bonds, or squeeze through tight spaces. Success on a Contortion Test indicates the Explorer can fold, twist, or otherwise contort his body for the intended purpose.\n\nSpecial Use: Escape Bonds\nThe Explorer can make a Contortionist Test to slip free of restraining bonds. This is an Opposed Test with the character's Contortionist Skill against his opponent's Strength Characteristic Test. Outside of combat, the Explorer can use this skill to reduce the time used to escape bonds. Each Degree of Success reduces this time by one minute. Each Degree of Failure imposes a cumulative -10 penalty upon subsequent attempts at escaping bonds.\n\nSpecial Use: Escape Grapple\nWhen an opponent has Grappled the Explorer in combat, he can make an Opposed Test with his Contortionist Skill against the grappler's Strength Characteristic Test. Winning the Test means the Explorer has freed himself; failure means he remains grappled or has suffered damage from the enemy.\n\nSpecial Use: Squeeze Through\nThe Explorer can make a Contortionist Test to squeeze through a tight space, such as a half-remote junction aboard a ship or a gap between doors warped open by damage. The difficulty is based on the Explorer's Agility. One Degree of Success reduces the time required by one Combat Round. Failure means the Explorer has become stuck until he succeeds at another Contortionist Test or until someone pulls him free. Squeeze Through takes a minute with each Test requiring a Full Action."

      "text": "DECEIVE (BASIC, INTERACTION)\nFellowship\nThe Deceive skill enables an Explorer to fool another character, mislead others with lies, or deliver tall tales with a straight face. This might involve telling a direct lie, convincing another character that the Explorer is not a threat, spreading false rumors, or obscuring the truth with partial truths. The Skill Test is often an Opposed Test using the Deceive Skill against the opponent's Scrutiny Skill, though the GM may assign bonuses or penalties to reflect the difficulty of the deception. For complex deceptions (see page 229), the GM may require multiple Deceive Tests as the falsehood persists and becomes more complicated.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nDEMOLITION (ADVANCED, CRAFTING)\nIntelligence\nThe Explorer can use the Demolition Skill to employ explosives with the proper quantity to achieve the desired effect (from cutting through steel doors to destroying bunkers or disabling reactors). Without sufficient knowledge and the correct device, most applications of this skill result in premature or catastrophic explosions. When placing or defusing explosives, this Skill pertains to precise timing, using fuses, or setting charges.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action unless otherwise noted.\n\nSpecial Use: Manufacture Explosives\nThe Demolition Skill allows an Explorer to make explosives using Trade Skills and components. This use of the Demolition Skill is an Extended Test with both difficulty and duration depending on the complexity of the compound and the Explorer's access to proper chemicals.\n\nSpecial Use: Place Explosives\nThe Explorer places an explosive device; depending on whether the Explorer knows the building's or starship's layout, using a well-placed explosive means making a successful Demolition Test. Failure indicates the Explorer will fail to achieve the desired result.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nSpecial Use: Defuse Explosives\nAn Explorer can attempt to use the Demolition Skill to defuse explosives. Make an Opposed Demolition Test against the individual who set the explosives. Winning the Test indicates the Explorer succeeds in defusing the device before it goes off; failure meaning that the charge has been armed incorrectly and may go off prematurely at the GM's discretion.\n\nDISGUISE (BASIC)\nFellowship\nDisguise allows the Explorer to hide features or assume another's appearance. The difficulty of the Test depends on the materials available and the differences between the character and the desired appearance, and any other elements that would affect the deception.\n\nDisguise rolls are Opposed Tests against an observer's Scrutiny skill. More casual observers might not notice the disguise at all, while minute details of the impersonation may trick only the most elementary scrutiny. When wearing a disguise for a significant stretch of time, the GM may require additional Disguise Tests to verify the disguise remains effective.\n\nSkill Use: Variable.\n\nDODGE (BASIC, COMBAT)\nAgility\nDodge skill is a Reaction to nullify a successful hand-to-hand or ranged attack that has been inflicted, dealing with attacks that have gotten through the Explorer's guard and deals damage to him. Characters with the Dodge Skill may use this Skill without penalty in situations where they have forewarning of an attack.\n\nSkill Use: Reaction.\n\nDRIVE (ADVANCED, OPERATOR)\nAgility\nSkill Groups: Ground Vehicle, Skimmer, Walker.\n\nDrive allows an Explorer to control land-based or airborne vehicles. Vehicles include ground-based (wheeled, tracked, or hover-based) vehicles, skimmers (air-cushion vehicles), or walkers (mech-like bipedalrobotic striders).\n\nNormally, just driving along requires no Skill Test, but driving under stressed or hazardous conditions may require a Test according to the vehicle type involved. Failure to achieve the desired result indicates that the Explorer will fail to control the vehicle properly at this time.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action."

      "text": "EVALUATE (BASIC, INVESTIGATION)\nIntelligence\nThe Explorer can evaluate to determine the quality and condition of an object. The GM sets difficulty, duration, and other factors the Skill can be considered through. When presented with an item sold at market, the Evaluate Test reveals the item's availability, whether it qualifies for an Acquisition Modifier (see page 272). Additional Degrees of Success will expose more information about the object. Failures return incorrect information about the item.\n\nEvaluate can be useful for estimating the value of collective items or markets with each Degree of Success adding to the value of the collection. The GM should roll Evaluate Tests and reveal what the Explorer believes is the true value of the item and the time allowed by the merchant.\n\nEvaluate sometimes requires an Extended Test, though the Explorer can appraise single items about prices. Additional Evaluate Tests require multiple sources to consistently verify the mechanisms and pricing (see 277). Pricing requires an Extended Test, and the GM may gradually increase the Difficulty.\n\nSkill Use: Variable. Nice!\n\nFORBIDDEN LORE (ADVANCED, INVESTIGATION)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Adeptus Mechanicus, Archeotech, Daemonology, Heresy, The Inquisition, Mutants, Navigators, Pirates, Psykers, Warp, and Xenos.\n\nForbidden skills refer to knowledge that is dangerous, hidden, or proscribed. Knowledge may cause authorities to question the informant's network, motivations, and sometimes even sanity. Forbidden Lore represents knowledge that is not routinely taught, handed down by word or tradition rather than formal education.\n\nA successful Forbidden Lore Test indicates the Explorer remembers some basic information about the subject. The GM will reveal appropriate information according to the Degree of Success:\n\nAdeptus Mechanicus: In-depth understanding of mysterious inner workings of the Machine God, including their ceremonies, beliefs, philosophies, rituals, and more. Additional degrees of success reveal more detailed information.\n\nArcheotech: Knowledge of the precious devices of past ages, their mysterious functions and purposes.\n\nDaemonology: Lore about some of the most infamous daemons and their twisted physical manifestations.\n\nHeresy: Information concerning faiths decreed Hereticus by the Imperium, historically famous heretics, and the rites and ceremonies of their bloody cults.\n\nThe Inquisition: Forbidden recollection of the Inquisition, including famous Inquisitors.\n\nMutants: Knowledge of mutation within humanity, their cancerous influence and mutagenic development.\n\nNavigators: Secret knowledge about the Navis Nobilite houses of the few, the training of Navigators, their racial peculiarities from the physical effects of their powers.\n\nPirates: Extent of the famous pirate fleets, their locations, infamous captains, and trading routes.\n\nPsykers: Knowledge of their manifestations and connection with Chapter VIII's depiction of powers and eddies called Warpstorms.\n\nWarp: An understanding of the energy of the Warp, its creatures, connections, and disturbances.\n\nXenos: Knowledge of aliens from outside the Imperium, the threat they pose, and their powers.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action."

      "text": "GAMBLE (BASIC)\nIntelligence\nThe Explorer with this Skill participates in games of chance. In an Opposed Test, the Explorer makes an Opposed Test with the player with the most Degrees of Success or fewest Degrees of Failure winning the pot. The Explorer may attempt a +10 bonus against the other player with worse rolls by attempting to conceal cards or alter dice rolls. Success gives the character a bonus on his next bet, but four Degrees of Failure indicate he has been caught in the act.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action for simple games; 1d5 hours for complex games.\n\nINQUIRY (BASIC, INVESTIGATION)\nFellowship\nInquiry allows an Explorer to extract information from others through interviews, eavesdropping, subtle observation, etc. This Investigation Skill allows an Explorer to articulate items from others by asking questions in the right way. While Charm may set the disposition of the person being questioned, Inquiry determines how much information the subject will provide.\n\nDifficulty and Duration are set by the GM. Additional information can be found in Chapter IX: Playing the Game on Interaction Tests.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nSpecial Use: Hunt for Sedition\nInquiry among a given population can root out rumors of mutants, pirates, malcontents, malcontents, and dissidents. An explorer making Inquiry Tests among a crew about quality influences from the void would need to roll. For every point the ship's Population is reduced, add a +5 bonus to Inquiry rolls for finding seditious comments. The population suffers from the physical effects of the void.\n\nINTERROGATION (ADVANCED)\nWillpower\nInterrogation allows the Explorer to extract information from unwilling subjects. The application differs from Inquiry in that questions cannot be easily deflected or evaded. Interrogation represents a skilled application of psychology, pain, and consequence. The GM may set the Difficulty of the Test according to the availability of tools.\n\nThough intense sessions can last for months, a simple Interrogation is an Opposed Fellowship Test against the opponent's Willpower. If the Explorer wins the Opposed Test, he gets one answer phrased as a question for each Degree of Success. If the opponent wins the Opposed Test, he becomes conditioned against further Interrogation attempts for 1d5 days. If the Explorer suffers four Degrees of Failure, the subject's Willpower Bonus prevents any further questioning for 1d10 days.\n\nThe Explorer may instead use methods employing physical torture, in which case the Explorer uses Intimidate (Strength) and the target defends with a Willpower-based Test. Those with both Skills may hide cards.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action for simple intimidation; hourly or daily for prolonged efforts.\n\nINTIMIDATE (BASIC, INTERACTION)\nStrength\nThe Intimidate Skill forces individuals to give in to demands. The character does not merely make physical threats, but only a suggestion of conformity through dominating Strength. The Explorer's manifestation can be through Intelligence or Fellowship rather than intimidation. The character typically uses threats in a direct tongue, which may involve blackmail, humiliation, or simple powerful words via the Explorer's Intelligence or Fellowship.\n\nIntimidate Tests affect a single target unless environmental factors suggest otherwise. Entities facing the Explorer's Strength, Intelligence, or Fellowship Bonus (depending on the characteristic used for the test) and hear him clearly either personally or within sight of the Explorer. Within communication earshot would incur a -10 penalty.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action."

This may include casting out minor daemonic influences, providing protection against psychic powers, or channeling the Emperor's power during a Sanctioning Test. A successful Invocation Test indicates that the Explorer's will overrides the hostile influence and keeps it at bay.\n\nFailure alternatively damages the Explorer's Faith Protection Wand (by 1 point). A failed Invocation Test indicates that the Explorer's contributions are unwelcome, ending abruptly. For further information, see Chapter IX: Playing the Game; Powers Tests within Invocation reduce Faith by 1d5 for each Test failed. If the power fails, the invoker must make a successful Willpower Test equal to 20 plus the Psy Rating of the power. Failure earns the GM Complication Points to spend against him. Invocation is a Full Action.\n\nSkill Use: Full Actions.\n\nLITERACY (ADVANCED)\nIntelligence\nLiteracy allows the Explorer to read and write any language he can speak. Literary activities would not require a Literacy Test, but scholarly activities involving variations, damaged manuscripts, archaic writing, or colloquial speech may necessitate a Literacy Test. Additional information can be found in various chapters.\n\nSkill Use: 1 minute for several 750 words.\n\nLOGIC (BASIC)\nIntelligence\nThe Explorer can use Logic to solve puzzles, decipher patterns, and deal with other situations involving deductions and Logic Tests might infer the missing piece in a particularly mathematical solution. Use of Logic is essential for debate or philosophical exchange. Multi-component problems are Extended Tests.\n\nSkill Use: 1 minute for particularly simple problems.\n\nMEDICAE (ADVANCED)\nIntelligence\nThe Medicae Skill comes into play when tending wounds, operating equipment, applying counter-septics, and using medical devices. Emergency medical attention and physio-therapy falls into this area. Medical diagnosis, First Aid, Extended Care, and the like are common applications.\n\nMedicae can help prevent fewer overall deaths when trained properly. Medicae can help diagnose and identify medical problems and apply the proper course of action.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nSpecial Use: First Aid\nThe Medicae Skill performs basic first aid through bandaging wounds, applications, and plugging punctures. A successful Medicae Test removes Damage equal to the Explorer's Intelligence Bonus; allowing lightly damaged characters to recover one point from damage sustained, or critically damaged characters to stabilize. The target benefits from First Aid once per encounter.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action.\n\nSpecial Use: Extended Care\nUsing the Medicae Skill for extended care speeds the healing process. The Explorer tends patients more extensively than usual while utilizing a medical bay. The Explorer applies his Intelligence Bonus to his Medicae Test; each additional patient imposes a cumulative -10 penalty to Medicae Tests. For lightly damaged patients, make one Test at the end of each day. For critically damaged patients, make one Test at the end of each week. Success allows the patient to recover damage points. Each Degree of Success adds one extra damage point; failure does not result in additional damage. Three Degrees of Failure indicate that lightly damaged patients gain no benefit and heavily damaged patients worsen, gaining Critical Damage (see page 250). Four Degrees of Failure indicate Long Suffering Death to Critically Damaged patients.\n\nAdditional information on healing can be found in Chapter IX: Playing the Game.\n\nSpecial Use: Diagnose\nMedicae can often be used to identify strange ailments. This diagnostic approach looks at individuals, groups, or entire landing parties. A successful Skill Test can prevent casualties to crew population due to parasites, contamination, radiation poisoning, or fanning planar echoes.\n\nSkill Use: Variable."

      "text": "NAVIGATION (ADVANCED, EXPLORATION)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Surface, Stellar, Warp.\n\nThe Explorer uses Navigation to plot a safe course through any domain. Navigation Tests determine whether the Explorer finds a suitable path through the environment.\n\nSurface Navigation encompasses maps, terrain, orientation, and geological knowledge when traveling overland on a planet's surface using logi-compasses and geographical knowledge of the territory.\n\nStellar Navigation relies upon geller field generators, holo-compasses, and gyro-mantic rituals to plot a route through the tides of realspace. It determines which astronomical reference points a ship reaches; its destination, through the recording of astro-mantic reference marks using computers. A successful Stellar Navigation Test determines how quickly a ship reaches its destination. Failed Stellar Navigation Tests indicate that the ship misses its destination, usually requiring course corrections and hours or minutes of travel time.\n\nWarp Navigation concerns travel directly through the warp, where the flow of time varies, distorted, and currents are subject to massive shifts in resonance. It requires a Navigator's Skill for charting a correct route through the Warp. The skills of Warp Navigators are essential for long-distance voyages through unsurveyed regions. More information on Warp Travel is found in Chapter IX: Playing the Game.\n\nSkill Use: Initial Test - one minute; Course corrections - one hour.\n\nPERFORMER (ADVANCED)\nFellowship\nSkill Groups: Dancer, Musician, Singer, Storyteller.\n\nThe Explorer's Performer Skill can entertain and enthrall others. The audience's reaction to the performance depends on the Explorer's Performer Test. Choose from the skill groups: Dancer, Musician, Singer, or Storyteller.\n\nSkill Use: Variable.\n\nSpecial Use: Charming Performance\nThe Explorer may make a Difficult (+0) Performer (Dancer) or Performer (Singer) Test instead of a Charm Test when evaluating crowd disposition while attempting to improve morale. When improving morale in a large gathering, a successful Test adds the Explorer's Fellowship Bonus to recent Willpower Tests by individuals in the crowd.\n\nSpecial Use: Enthralling Performance\nThe Explorer may make a Difficult (+0) Performer (Musician) or Performer (Singer) Test instead of a Performer Test when attempting to entrance the audience or distract them from another objective. While evaluating the audience's reaction, those momentarily entranced may lose track of time, place, or matter at hand. Common distractions include musical performances to cover the sounds of combat/theft.\n\nPILOT (ADVANCED, OPERATOR)\nAgility\nSkill Groups: Personal, Flyers, Space Craft.\n\nExplorers use the Pilot Skill to fly anything from personal atmosphere jumpers to void-faring fighters and bombers and capital ships. Under ordinary conditions, Piloting does not require a Skill Test. Tests are only needed in direct conditions such as facing storms, tight atmospheres, dangerous maneuvers or dogfighting. When chasing another vehicle, collisions, and avoiding asteroids, his opponent compares Pilot Tests. Starships can engage in space combat (see Chapter IX: Starships).\n\nSkill Use: Half Action."

The Skill also allows detection of psychic phenomena like hauntings in the warp.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action.\n\nSuccess Result:\n1 Degree: Approximate direction of the phenomena.\n2 Degrees: Range affecting the manifestation.\n3 Degrees: Exact location of the psychic presence.\n\nSpecial Use: Astropathic Interference\nPsyniscience may be used to block the communication beyond Astropath choir to any Astropath on the ship, jamming transmissions and interfering with Astropathic choir. If successful, the blocking persists for 1d10 hours, preventing the targeted Astropath's ship from Sending or Receiving Astropathic transmissions for the duration set by the GM.\n\nSCHOLASTIC LORE (ADVANCED, INVESTIGATION)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Archaic, Astromancy, Beasts, Bureaucracy, Chymistry, Cryptology, Heraldry, Imperial Creed, Judgement, Legend, Navis Nobilite, Numerology, Occult, Philosophy, Tactica Imperialis.\n\nScholastic Lore allows the Explorer to recall knowledge from academic sources. A successful Test allows the Explorer to access information about the subject according to the character's specialties. Scholastic Lore represents an education seldom available to common folk, requiring both experience and study.\n\nAcademic Skills differ from Common Lore and Forbidden Lore. Scholastic Lore represents more in-depth knowledge of a particular area. When making a Scholastic Lore Test, the Explorer's area of specialization permits more detailed knowledge of the following:\n\nArchaic: Knowledge of ancient times when humanity's reach extended beyond what it currently covers; historical events that changed the Imperium, forbidden or proscribed knowledge concerning the Dark Age of Technology, the Age of Strife, Standard Template Constructs, and the Horus Heresy.\n\nAstromancy: Lore concerning higher mathematics and calculations that form the basis of all interstellar travel and the operation of starships, and also predicts the movement of planetoids, suns, and other stellar objects.\n\nBeasts: Knowledge of creatures, their nature, and the lore and ways of monsters and beasts, including familiarity with aberrations and mutations.\n\nBureaucracy: Familiarity with the rules and regulations of the Adeptus Administratum, its appearance, hierarchy, and familiar departments.\n\nChymistry: Knowledge of elements, compounds, chemicals, and formulae for creating pharmaceuticals or other interesting concoctions.\n\nCryptology: Understanding of codes, ciphers, esoteric languages, and numerical keys. This may enable decoding electronic communications.\n\nHeraldry: Knowledge of the principles and devices of Heraldry, including emblems, sigils, and house markings of Imperial Houses.\n\nImperial Creed: Understanding of the foundation of the Ecclesiarchy, from the traditions, construction of their temples, rites, rituals for daily prayer, the proper punishments for the heretic, and the unshakable faith of mankind.\n\nJudgement: Knowledge of the law and legal traditions, including the Arbites, Administratum, and other organizations monitoring the practice of Imperial law.\n\nLegend: Deep knowledge concerning the secret or most secretive portions of Imperial history such as the Dark Age of Technology, the Age of Strife, Commander Macharius, and the Horus Heresy.\n\nNavis Nobilite: Lore concerning the family trees, contracts, and information concerning the great houses of the Navigators.\n\nNumerology: Understanding of mathematics, the physical universe formed of numbers, patterns, and theoretical studies of astrography revealing clues that mankind's mantic schools, the influence of numerological calculation on ancient rituals, and the Cult of Numbers.\n\nOccult: Understanding of the theories of thought, belief, existence, and other intangibles. Also includes metaphysical, logic, and ancient philosophical works.\n\nTactica Imperialis: The theories of the Tactica Imperialis, theoretical systems, deployment, and battle tactics. Familiarity with the Imperium's regiments, historical battles, and noted commanders. An Explorer with this knowledge may be able to deduce the likely flow of war or predict where Imperial forces will be strongest.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action; Extended Test: Duration and Difficulty appropriate to the task."

      "text": "SCRUTINY (BASIC)\nPerception\nScrutiny skill brings answers to the Explorer in general everyday encounters. The character watches and listens intently, determining if an individual should be noted as this might be exceedingly beneficial. Lines and generally art, a prosody (studied language details and characteristics that make false statements easier to detect), and contextual issues may all pass in front of the Explorer's scrutiny.\n\nScrutiny may be Opposed if facing the target's Deceive Skill when uncovering falsehoods, deceptions, or hidden secret plots. Scrutiny is most useful when examining a person carefully or examining a situation. This Skill covers the careful interpretation of complex interaction skills such as Charm, Prosody, and Deceive. It also may be used when an Explorer is attempting to read the intent of others.\n\nAboard starships this skill operates and interprets the ship's sensor readings, which require special skills for interpretation and command. (See Chapter VI: Starships for details.)\n\nSkill Use: Full Action.\n\nSEARCH (BASIC, EXPLORATION)\nPerception\nThe Explorer's Search Skill covers the art of thorough detection. Search differs from Awareness in many ways; whereas Awareness involves subconscious detection, Search deals explicitly with actively seeking items that have been deliberately hidden. The Search Test is Opposed when the item has been Concealed by others. The GM may set the Difficulty of the Test according to the complexity of the scene or how small the object is. Some Tests may be Extended Tests. See the Tech-Use Skill for systems that combine both mechanical and technical challenges.\n\nSpecial Use: Inspection\nThe Search skill can also be used to find hidden stowaways, sabotage among ship's systems, smaller scraps, and even evidence of sabotage aboard a starship. Depending on the size of the vehicle, the GM may designate this an Extended Test with multiples of appropriate hours, minutes, or seconds. Duration is variable; each Degree of Success reduces the time.\n\nSkill Use: Minute; reduced by Degrees of Success.\n\nSECRET TONGUE (ADVANCED)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Military, Navigators, Rogue Trader, Tech, Underdeck.\n\nEach organization in the Imperium develops their own secret tongue; only those native to a specific organization or with close association would comprehend a particular jargon. Some resemble codes, ciphers, or other forms of communication based on physical cues, a piece of unusual dress, code words, posture, or bodies in motion. Skill Tests are necessary when attempting to communicate complex concepts; requires a successful Intelligence Test for speaker to make the communication intelligible to the listener.\n\nAdministratum: Collection of acronyms, reference numerals, and codification historically used in archaic High Gothic by the Adeptus Administratum.\n\nEcclesiarchy: An allegorical language of devotion and politics drawn from religious references and characteristics that make pious statements easier to detect.\n\nMilitary: Slang and coded phrases, oral mnemonic references to ancient battles and commands.\n\nNavigators: Secret pattern language that maintains the internal situation of the Ancient Nobilite families' keep. The language alludes to old tongues passed from generation to generation.\n\nRogue Trader: Essentially a more complex Home-speak; it differs from Fellowship Interaction skills such as Charm Home-speak, Prosody, and Deceive. It represents station and coded commands.\n\nTech: Encoded binary language including high and low Gothic via aural modulation through special code modifications for optical pulses.\n\nUnderdeck: Crude Low Gothic dialects used in the bilge and lower decks of most Imperial vessels. It includes colorful slang, accent variations, and nitty expressions of the local population.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action.\n\nSECURITY (ADVANCED, EXPLORATION)\nAgility\nSecurity deals with both mechanical and electronic locks as well as other protective components. This differs from Tech-Use because it focuses on simple mechanical aspects (locks, collars, etc.) instead of complex technology. The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test according to the complexity of the lock or device. Some Tests may be Extended Tests as appropriate.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action; time depends on complexity. Most locks require Extended Tests."

Techniques might include false identities, disguises, coverings, boardings, and other techniques to evade detection while maintaining normal appearances. Shadowing Tests are almost always Opposed Tests against the opponent's Awareness or Scrutiny Skill; a simple Shadowing Test is sufficient for animals.\n\nThe GM may suggest appropriate Difficulty modifiers for tracking a target through a crowd. For moving within a crowd, normal shadowing requires five or more bodies to be counted as a crowd.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action.\n\nSILENT MOVE (BASIC, MOVEMENT)\nAgility\nSilent Move Skill maintains silence in the Explorer's activities. The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test depending on the environment: metallic echoing decks on a starship yield a Very Difficult (-30) Test, while the officers' quarters with paneled, carpeted walls might be an Easy (+30) Test. Silent Move is almost always Opposed against the opponent's Awareness or Scrutiny Skill; unusual alien environments may call for a penalty to Movement rates as the Explorer moves across an audible plain.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action as part of Movement.\n\nSLEIGHT OF HAND (ADVANCED)\nAgility\nThe Explorer's Sleight of Hand Skill represents dexterity with small objects, performing tricks, subtle art, and fine manipulation. This Skill can also apply to stealing objects or picking pockets. The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test according to the size of the object and the intensity of observation; Sleight of Hand is usually made as an Opposed Test against the opponent's Awareness or Scrutiny.\n\nThe Explorer's Sleight of Hand is useful when gambling and altering the fall of dice or cards. See the Gamble skill for more information. Though Sleight of Hand usually requires a Half Action, the Explorer may make a Full Action to use this Skill.\n\nSkill Use: Half Action.\n\nSPEAK LANGUAGE (ADVANCED)\nIntelligence\nSkill Groups: Eldar, Explorator, Binary, High Gothic, Low Gothic, Ork, Techan, Trader's Cant.\n\nSpeak Language allows the Explorer to communicate with others using the language's natural form. The character understands both verbal or written forms of the language and can make himself understood through either method. Without Literacy, the character cannot write the language but may speak it fluently.\n\nBinary: Hexadecimal noosphere language of the Adeptus Mechanicus, including chirps, clicks, and other coded vox-burst emissions.\n\nEldar: Though most exodites require the subtle layering of meanings, a cunning individual versed in the ancient tongue can manage an especially reserved conversation.\n\nExplorator: A simple form of Mechanicus binary that includes many vox-emitter patterns divided from its pure form through time. This language has been optimized for rapid delivery of mission-critical commands.\n\nHigh Gothic: The official language of the Imperium; used by officials, religious members, bureaucrats, and the military. This ancient language has been carried for ten thousand years by purity of faith alone.\n\nLow Gothic: The common tongue of the Imperium. Over millennia, this easy language has been optimized for rapid understanding and command; like High Gothic, this language has been spoken for ten thousand years.\n\nOrk: Pidgin language of these xenos, often punctuated by grunts, growls, and staccato body language.\n\nTechan: Secret tongue of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the language which only a small portion can speak, including high principles of data and numeric theory.\n\nTrader's Cant: A pidgin employed when dealing with fellow traders which allows for rapid negotiation and exchange of information.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action."

He can also construct viable shelter from local materials located through use of this territory. A Survival Test requiring location and preparation of food on a planet might need the Survival Skill at Difficult level. Such Test requires a man-made environment as well. The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test according to the type of territory covered:\n\nNatural World: Jungles, forests, savannas.\nArtificial World: Mass of derelicts, asteroids, deep within the Underhive.\nDeath World: Extreme environments, high gravities, deadly radiation and knowing which plant can kill you.\n\nVery unusual environments may grant additional bonuses or penalties depending on the extremities of the conditions. Though Survival usually applies to a single Explorer's personal needs, adjusting them as necessary, it can also be applied to a group. For each person beyond the first that Survival supports, apply a -10 penalty.\n\nSkill Use: Variable depending on the GM's discretion; determining water supplies takes an hour, finding food takes 1d5 hours.\n\nSWIM (BASIC, MOVEMENT)\nStrength\nSwim allows the Explorer to move through liquid mediums. Under benign conditions, swimming requires no Tests. More difficult waters require Tests. Very unusual circumstances (distance, strength currents, etc.) may reduce movement rates. For more information on Swimming, see Section Four on page 167 of Chapter IX: Playing the Game.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action.\n\nTECH-USE (ADVANCED, EXPLORATION)\nIntelligence\nTech-Use allows the Explorer to maintain both mechanical and electronic devices. Using or repairing cogitator equipment or other common technological devices under normal conditions typically requires no Test, such as opening a shuttle hatch. Tech-Use Tests are necessary in unusual situations where complex operations may be necessary.\n\nRepairing damaged tech components generally requires an Extended Test with Duration and Difficulty set by the GM, depending on the extent of the damage. Tech-Use allows the Explorer to determine the function of complex technology when operating for Standard Template Constructs or Common Imperial technology. Made from minute study of both tech-lore and practical experience, the Explorer's Tech-Use deals with standard items and other field options.\n\nExtended Test Duration and Difficulty is set by the GM depending on the complexity and extent of the damage. Tech-Use differs from Trade Skills in that while Tech-Use concerns interfacing with technology, Trade Skills usually involve much deeper understanding of technology.\n\nSkill Use: Full Action for small jobs; Variable for more complex tasks."

For additional information on variants of the Trade skill, see below:\n\nArchaeologist: Used to locate and identify ancient items or fragments.\n\nArmourer: Used to construct, design, and forge weaponry.\n\nAstrographer: Used to create 3D and inter-dimensional holomaps well located in 3D spaces and Warp routes.\n\nChymist: Used to create proper potions and compounds.\n\nCryptographer: Used to uncover obscure patterns, codes, and ciphers.\n\nExplorator: Used to recover lost technology.\n\nLinguist: Used to decipher new languages, both spoken and written.\n\nRemembrance: Used to recount events in a variety of perfect recollection from surface details and atmospheric patterns to entire ceremonies.\n\nShipwright: Most important design upgrade steam engineering trade for colonial ships.\n\nSoothsayer: Used to foretell the future by reading numbers or watching the signs of both Chartist ships and fortune tellers horoscopes.\n\nTechnomat: Used to maintain and repair technological devices.\n\nValet: Used to understand the protocols of alien cultures controlling a servant and making perfect understanding of the proper poised formal dress.\n\nSkill Use: Variable depending on the GM's discretion, modify by Difficulty.\n\nTRACKING (ADVANCED, EXPLORATION)\nIntelligence\nThe Tracking Skill lets the Explorer follow the signs left by his quarry. Following obvious trails does not require Skill Tests, and a trained Explorer can find even the most carefully hidden trail. The Explorer makes an Assessment Test to detect the Difficulty depends on following the trail. Use the following table:\nNormal Trail: Average (+0).\nCovered Trail: Challenging (-10).\nSurface: Average (+0), damaged earth/grass; Challenging (-10), coarse or ice.\nFirefight Trail: Average (+0), scorched ground.\nAge: Fresh, Average (+0); one day, Challenging (-10).\nWeather: Clear, Average (+0); rain or snow, Difficult (-20).\n\nThe Explorer may use this Skill with Interrogation if the Explorer knew where his opponent has attempted to hide his tracks. Tracking may also be used to follow an unfamiliar pathway or in dusky woodland settings where a target has tried to lose a trail. For an Opposed Test, opponent must make a Concealment Test. The Difficulty is modified by above environmental factors.\n\nSkill Use: Free Action made as part of Movement.\n\nWRANGLING (ADVANCED)\nIntelligence\nThe Explorer can use this Skill to handle potentially rare animals, whether trained or untrained. This includes everything from riding through to handling xenobeasts, spine-wolves, noble steeds, purchase of barn animals, and all variety of beasts. Wrangling requires an Extended Test, which is determined by the GM depending on the time involved to tame or master a particular beast. The character's relationship with particularly strong-willed or intelligent beasts can be changed by one level for two Degrees of Success, or three levels by three Degrees of Success. When using this Skill, GMs may impose penalties for particularly rare creatures that wish to simply kill humanoids."

      "text": "CHAPTER IV:\nTALENTS\n\"Eyes Recent to shoot, a number of Talents during the creation of their character. Character Creation gain skills and Talents, choosing from the Advances through the Career Paths outlined in the player's education. Talents reflect years of practice throughout the disciplines and serve as a primer for a too-long story reaching a colorful bang-out or retreat for War.\"\n—Ghilym Currith\n\nTALENT GROUPS\nSeveral Talents represent related abilities that can be applied within that group. Whereas Skills represent abilities gained through learning, Talents provide increased proficiency in certain specific areas. Talent Groups have ability sub-categories; they have been collected into related groups when selecting one Talent. For example, an Explorator might gain additional graces from these Talents, whereas a Navigator might choose a more general nature which the Talent applies. Similarly, when choosing an entry from the Peer Talent group, a rising aristo might select Peer (Nobility) as his most honored organization, while a hardened spacer surviving combat with a feral primitive might opt for Peer (Imperial Guard) instead.\n\nEach Explorer gains a Talent, Heightened Senses being one example, that allows him to choose a different specialization from the group. When a character acquires another entry from a Talent group, he must choose a different specialization. For example, an Explorer who has the Peer (Administratum) Talent could later acquire the Peer (Mechanicus) Talent, but not another instance of Peer (Administratum).\n\nSome Talent groups are all-inclusive. For example, the Peer Talent group represents ability; Peer in general grants a bonus to social interactions with a semi-specific group or people who share the same profession or background. Talents are an enjoyable process for players as they create interesting, well-rounded characters, individuals that make for good advancing relationships and adventures.\n\nGAINING TALENTS\nTALENT PREREQUISITES\nSeveral Talents require the Explorer to possess a minimum Characteristic value or training (for example, a Skill or other Talent) before they can be selected. This represents either attaining a certain level of ability or having developed capabilities. The Explorer must meet all prerequisites to select the Talent. See Chapter II: Career Paths for full descriptions of Talents available to Rogue Trader Career Paths."

      "text": "TALENT DESCRIPTIONS\nAUTOSANGUINE\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants, Common Lore (Tech), Tech-Use\nBlessed technology of the Mechanicus flows through the Explorer's blood. These minuscule machine spirits enhance his blood with remarkable repair properties. When applying healing, he is always considered a \"Good Quality\" Medikit with \"Good Quality\" components. However, the Explorator becomes affected by anti-tech fields just like a servitor.\n\nBASIC WEAPON TRAINING\nTalent Groups: Las, Launcher, Primitive, SP, Universal\nThe Explorer has received Basic Weapon Training and may fire weapons of the chosen type without penalty. The Universal group includes Las, Launcher, Melta, Plasma, SP, and Primitive weapons. When selecting Basic Weapon Training Talent for the second time, it must be in a different category than previously selected.\n\nAIR OF AUTHORITY\nPrerequisites: Fellowship 30\nThe Explorer commands attention when entering a room, either motivating or terrifying those under his command. On a successful Command Test, the Explorer affects a number of targets equal to his Fellowship Bonus. This talent has no effect on those not already under the Explorer's authority.\n\nBASTION OF IRON WILL\nPrerequisites: Psy Rating 3, Strong Minded, Will Power 40\nYears of practice and training have made the Explorer a defensive Psy master. He dominates the defensive aspects of his powers. In any Opposed Test involving the Psychic Technique against a defensive Psychic power, the Explorer adds his Willpower Bonus to the result. This effect does not apply to offensive powers and lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Willpower Bonus.\n\nAMBIDEXTROUS\nPrerequisites: Agility 30\nThis Talent does not represent true ambidexterity where both hands make the director cuts smoothly. The Explorer either hand equally well for any purpose and does not suffer the -20 penalty for actions using his off-hand. Special: This Talent combines with Two Weapon Wielder Talents; the penalty for making attacks with both weapons is reduced to 0.\n\nBATTLE RAGE\nPrerequisites: Strength 40\nThe Explorer combines incredible savagery and an indomitable will focused on directing his rage while still fighting effectively. While Frenzied, he can Dodge or Parry while Frenzied.\n\nBERSERK CHARGE\nPrerequisites: Battle Rage\nThe Explorer throws his whole force at his enemy, his weapon flowing with his movement. When he uses the Charge Action, he adds his Weapon Skill instead of +10 to hit, and adds his Strength Bonus to damage.\n\nBINARY CHATTER\nPrerequisites: Techna-Lingua\nThe Explorer's constant binary cant forms a subtle pattern in his controlling sentience. He receives a +10 bonus to any attempt to influence cogitators, dataports, and machine spirit devices upon which he has used Techna-Lingua.\n\nASSASSIN STRIKE\nPrerequisites: Agility 40, Acrobatics\nThe Explorer's natural agility and graceful martial movements deliver silent death on the battlefield. After making a successful Acrobatics Test, the Explorer's next attack gains +30 to hit. The free attack resulting from this move applies the Explorer's Mastery of bladed weapons and unarmed strikes to enemies unaware of his attack. Special: May attack 1d5 foes per Round using this manner, as long as there is a way to get within melee weapon range. Time: Half Action."

    {
      "pageIndex": 98,
      "text": "BLADEMASTER\nThe Explorer's mastery of bladed weapons and well-maintained swords and knives allows him a bonus. He gains +10 to hit when attacking with any bladed weapon (including weapons with the Mono special quality). Special: May attack with two blades per Round as long as he is dual wielding, though the second weapon suffers a -10 penalty unless he also has Strong Hands and Combat Master Talents.\n\nBLESSED RADIANCE\nPrerequisites: Pure Faith, Unshakeable Faith\nThe Explorer's righteous conviction burns those who speak blasphemous untruths. While spending Faith Points, the Explorer extends his immunity to daemonic presence to a number of allies equal to his Willpower Bonus. They become immune to Fear and Pinning effects. In addition, affected targets take only half damage from any daemonic manipulations directed their way for the duration of the encounter. This ability only affects those within arm's reach of the Explorer when activated. Using this Talent is a Half Action.\n\nBLIND FIGHTING\nPrerequisites: Perception 30\nThe Explorer's other senses function exceptionally well in close combat without the benefit of sight. While under the rules for fighting in darkness or other vision-impairing conditions, the Explorer halves the penalties, rounding up. For darkness, fog, smoke, or tear gas, the Dark template penalties become -10 instead of -20.\n\nBLOODTRACKER\nPrerequisites: Awareness\nThe Explorer developed intuitive hunting instincts from bringing back the most dangerous prey alive. When pursuing or tracking quarry, the Explorer adds his Perception Bonus to his Tracking Test. Taking this Talent means the character is a Fighter, adding Objective Points to some causes of Insanity Point gain.\n\nBULGING BICEPS\nPrerequisites: Strength 40\nThe Explorer's strong build serves him well in melee combat. His massive muscles allow him to handle two-handed weapons with one hand. This removes the penalty to Agility Tests from using two-handed weapons. The normal penalty for attempting to wield a weapon without meeting the required Strength Bonus remains in effect.\n\nCATFALL\nPrerequisites: Agility 30\nGymnastic training and natural acrobatic agility enable the Explorer to land on his feet when falling from greater heights than normal. Whenever an Explorer makes an Agility Test to reduce damage from falling, he may reduce the distance fallen by a number of meters equal to his Agility Bonus.\n\nCOMBAT MASTER\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35\nThe Explorer's warrior spirit and dead accuracy even when surrounded make him more than a match for multiple skilled fighters. Opponents gain no additional bonuses when trying to encircle the character. Normally, when surrounded by multiple opponents, the character must defend himself from multiple angles; the Combat Master nullifies this penalty (see Chapter IX: Playing the Game).\n\nCOMBAT SENSE\nPrerequisites: Perception 30\nThe Explorer has the uncanny ability to recognize imminent threats to his person, particularly when a firefight erupts. He adds his Perception Bonus to his Initiative Tests, and adds his Perception Bonus or his Agility Bonus when rolling Initiative (whichever is higher).\n\nCONCEALED CAVITY\nThe character's cloak has secret compartments or the character has a small compartment, cavity, or false compartment hidden into the flesh. To detect this compartment requires a successful and Difficult (-10) Search Test focused on the compartment; casual search never reveals the compartment. The Explorer can hide a single small item (such as a simple weapon, multi-key, or data-slate) in this cavity. It requires a Difficult (-10) Scrutiny Test to detect that the Explorer is carrying something concealed in this compartment."

      "text": "COUNTER ATTACK\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 40\nThe Explorer's frightening response to foes proves they were slow enough to be seen. After successfully Parrying an attack, the character may immediately make a Standard Attack against the opponent who attacked him. This attack suffers a -20 penalty to the Weapon Skill Test. This attack counts as a Reaction.\n\nCRACK SHOT\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 40\nThe Explorer puts his efforts where they will inflict more critical damage. When he scores a hit with a ranged weapon, he adds his Intelligence Bonus to any rolls on the Critical Damage table.\n\nCRIPPLING STRIKE\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 50\nThe Explorer's sword blows precisely where they will inflict the most damage, cutting tendon and ligament with a surgeon's precision. When the character employs this Talent with a melee attack and struck on a called shot, he does +2 damage per Degree of Success.\n\nCRUSHING BLOW\nPrerequisites: Strength 40\nThe Explorer has the might to deal truly devastating blows. He adds half his Strength Bonus (rounded down) to damage inflicted with melee weapons (even those with the Primitive quality).\n\nDARK SOUL\nPrerequisites: Willpower 30, Fellowship 30, Strong Minded\nEverything about the Explorer seems tainted, foul, or disturbing. The Explorer reduces all Malignancy Tests by one degree. In addition, the character adds the Intimidate skill to any social dealings the character attempts, turning even the most benign conversation into a malevolent, threatening dialogue.\n\nDEADEYE SHOT\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 30\nThe Explorer's deadly accuracy and sharp eyesight combine to produce a feared marksman. No target, however, can escape his crosshairs. When making a Called Shot, the Explorer adds his Perception Bonus to his Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nDECADENCE\nPrerequisites: Toughness 40\nThrough conditioning or long years of abuse, the Explorer has developed distinctive resistances. When drinking alcohol or using drugs, the Explorer does not risk addiction or similar effects. When making Toughness Tests against chemicals or drugs, the Explorer gains a bonus to these Toughness Tests equal to twice his Toughness Bonus. The character also gains a +10 bonus to Carouse Tests against adverse effects of drugs or alcohol.\n\nDIE HARD\nPrerequisites: Willpower 40\nUnusually either willpower or sheer stubbornness keeps the Explorer moving even as he crosses into shadows. When he suffers from blood loss, he only needs to make a Toughness Test every other Round instead of every Round.\n\nDISARM\nPrerequisites: Agility 30\nThe Explorer can wrest weapons from foes through practiced techniques. To use this Talent, the Explorer must make an Opposed Weapon Skill Test as a Full Action. If he wins the Test, the opponent drops his weapon. For each Degree of Success on the Test, the Explorer may position the weapon 1 metre further away from his opponent.\n\nDISTURBING VOICE\nThe Explorer's voice is particularly horrifying or disquieting. Through natural mutation or possibly bionic vocal augmentation, the Explorer's voice cuts through a person's natural composition. The character receives a -10 penalty to Fellowship Tests when dealing with others in non-threatening situations. Whenever attempting an Intimidate Test, the Explorer gains a +10 bonus.\n\nDIVINE MINISTRATION\nPrerequisites: Pure Faith\nThe Explorer is a vessel for the Emperor's mercy and medical solace. When tending Medicae, the Explorer may spend a Fate Point to add his Faith Points to the standard amount of healing he restores with a successful Medicae Test."

      "pageIndex": 100,
      "text": "DUTY UNTO DEATH\nPrerequisites: True Grit\nThe Explorer's will sustains him when his flesh fails. When struck by a Stunning effect or Stunning Blow during combat, the Explorer may roll a Willpower Test as a Free Action. If successful, he ignores the Stunning effect for a number of people equal to twice his Willpower Bonus for the duration of the combat. If the Explorer is both Stunned and wounded by a single blow, the Explorer makes a single Willpower Test that, if successful, could allow him to ignore both effects and continue fighting normally.\n\nELECTRICAL SUCCOUR\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer can siphon power from his internal energy stores. Once per day, when affected by Fatigue or similar status effects, the Explorer may use a Full Action to temporarily remove 1 level of Fatigue for 1d10 minutes. If reduced to 0 Wounds, the Explorer's remaining machine spirit can recharge his waning flesh. Making a Hard (-20) Toughness Test, the Explorer automatically regains 1 Wound (maximum 1 per day) from his cybernetic restorative functions.\n\nDOUBLE TEAM\nThe Explorer has tactical experience coordinating combat attacks with his allies. When giving Up the Initiative to attack an opponent in melee combat, he and his allies gain an additional +10 bonus to their Weapon Skill Test. This bonus stacks with the normal +10 from multiple attackers, giving a total +20 bonus.\n\nDUAL SHOT\nPrerequisites: Agility 40, Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic)\nThe Explorer's skill is such that he can fire two pistols and hit effectively. When armed with two pistols, he may fire both simultaneously as a Full Action. Make a single Ballistic Skill Test with both shots hitting the same target. When firing both weapons in this manner, the Explorer does not suffer from the normal -20 BS Test penalty for using his off-hand. Any Weapon Traits apply to both shots individually, but any modifiers affecting both hits (such as Armour Points) are applied once. If using a weapon with a red-dot laser sight, he gains the normal +10 bonus. The Explorer can avoid both shots with a single successful Dodge Test.\n\nDUAL STRIKE\nPrerequisites: Agility 40, Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee)\nThe Explorer's skill with melee weapons lets him place two blows together with deadly precision. When armed with two melee weapons, he can attack with both simultaneously as a Full Action. Make a single Weapon Skill Test and, if successful, both weapons hit. They are both treated as swinging both weapons as part of a single Attack. The character may still take a Defensive Stance Reaction using either of his weapons. Additionally, if the Explorer has the Ambidextrous Talent, he suffers no penalty to hit when wielding two weapons with one hand, and both weapons roll for damage, resolving the effects of their successful hits actually as combined damage rolls of both weapons.\n\nENERGY CACHE\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer has created a special focus or power cache, which allows him to do without a power source for short periods. When using a powered weapon, the character may take a Challenging (-10) Tech-Use Test as a Free Action. If successful, the weapon can be used for 1d5 rounds without a functioning power source. When using this Talent, the weapon is counted as having the Unreliable quality.\n\nENHANCED BIONIC FRAME\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer's bionic body structure exceeds his earlier flesh representation. His targeting system linked to limbs and an exoskeleton spread throughout his non-biotic frame grants the Explorer gains the Auto-stabilised special quality (see page 139).\n\nEXOTIC WEAPON TRAINING\nTalent Groups: Exotic Weapon Group\nThe Explorer has received Exotic Weapon Training in a single exotic weapon. The Explorer can use this weapon without penalty. Exotic weapons are those that are so different from standard Imperial weapons that they must be trained independently for each weapon.\n\nFAVOURED BY THE WARP\nPrerequisites: Willpower 30\nWhenever psychic phenomena or Focus Power Test results in Psychic Phenomena, the Explorer may re-roll the result on that table and take the more favourable result. This bonus applies only to psychics; non-psykers gain no additional benefit.\n\nFEARLESS\nThrough hard experience with horrifying monsters, the Explorer has learned to master Fear and Pinning; his body and mind no longer commands the Explorer's actions when facing frightening enemies. The Explorer is immune to Fear and Pinning."

      "text": "FEEDBACK SCREECH\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer can release a piercing shriek through his dataports, systems, and augmetics. This hideous blast disrupts both machine spirits and flesh minds, causing pain and distraction to others. All organic and non-organic entities within his Fellowship Bonus in metres must make a Willpower Test or be Stunned for one Round. The Explorer can use this ability once per day. Using this Talent requires a Half Action.\n\nFERRIC LURE\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer has magnetic systems capable of drawing metal objects without touching them. A successful Willpower Test allows him to draw metal objects of up to 1 kilogram within his Intelligence Bonus times 2 metres towards his hand. The metal object flies in a straight line and requires a Full Action and successful Willpower Test to activate.\n\nFERRIC SUMMONS\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants, Ferric Lure\nThe Explorer can call a specifically designed metal object into his hand using his Ferric Lure Talent. This summons objects of up to 5 kilograms that are within a number of metres equal to his Willpower Bonus × 4 metres. Drawing the character's chosen object is a Full Action and requires a successful Willpower Test to activate this effect.\n\nFLAME WEAPON TRAINING\nTalent Groups: Universal\nThe sight of flaming streams of promethium brings joy to the Explorer's heart. He has mastered the flak-lash, burn, and recoil of flame weapons. The Universal Talent group allows the Explorer proficiency with all weapons with the Flame Trait (see page 139).\n\nFORESIGHT\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 30\nThe Explorer has a seemingly supernatural ability for reading and predicting the most likely outcome of events. By careful consideration of dice and examination of all evidence and information, he can identify the best path. When analyzing a problem, the character adds his Intelligence Bonus to a relevant Intelligence Test.\n\nFRENZY\nThe Explorer's temper and passion boil just below the surface, ready to be unleashed when needed. The character may enter a state and fight with uncontrolled ferocity. While the character is Frenzied, he gains a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill and Strength Tests, but suffers a -20 penalty to Intelligence and Fellowship Tests. When fighting while Frenzied, rolling three or more Degrees of Success on a successful Willpower Test allows him to remain in combat if he becomes Heavily Wounded. The Frenzy lasts for a number of Rounds equal to his Toughness Bonus, after which the character becomes Fatigued.\n\nFURIOUS ASSAULT\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 40\nThe Explorer's speed and ferocity overwhelm opponents, allowing him to land several blows where lesser combatants find just one. After making a successful attack against a foe in melee, he may immediately make an additional attack using the same melee weapon as a Reaction. This second attack suffers a -20 penalty to the Weapon Skill Test. This attack counts as a Free Reaction.\n\nGOOD REPUTATION\nPrerequisites: Fellowship 40\nTalent Group: Adeptus Arbites, Academics, Adeptus Astra Telepathica, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Government, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Imperial Nobility, Military, Middle Class, Navigators, Nobility, Rogue Traders, Veterans, Void Born, Workers, or Underworld.\n\nThe Explorer has garnered special merit with people from a certain organization, career, social class, or military group. When dealing with members of that organization, he gains a +10 bonus to all Fellowship Tests when interacting with the chosen group.\n\nGUARDIAN\nPrerequisites: Agility 40\nThe Explorer acts as a dedicated bodyguard to a trusted companion. If an ally within arm's reach takes damage, the Explorer may immediately switch places with the ally. He becomes the target of any attacks that would have struck the ally and suffers any damage, special effects, or conditions in their place. Using this Talent prevents the Explorer from taking any additional Reactions this Turn.\n\nGUN BLESSING\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer's sacred ability to whisper directly to machine spirits means his ranged weapons rarely malfunction. Whenever he would be required to make an Intelligence Test for his weapons to avoid jamming, he receives a +10 bonus. The gun's machine spirits are awakened by his presence.\n\nGUNSLINGER\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 40, Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic)\nThe Explorer has trained with pistols for so long that they are almost extensions of his own body, each gun harmonized with his targeting systems. When armed with two pistols, he gets both the benefit of Two-Weapon Fighting and may make attacks with both. If he also possesses the Ambidextrous Talent, the penalty is reduced to 0.\n\nHARD BARGAIN\nThe Explorer knows the secrets and techniques of the haggling art. By insulting his opponent's forebears, his goods, and pointing out flaws where others see nothing, the Explorer can drive down prices. Whenever making a Fellowship Test concerned with barter or negotiation, the Explorer adds his Fellowship Bonus to the result.\n\nHARD TARGET\nPrerequisites: Agility 30\nThe Explorer's quick reflexes allow him to duck, weave, and dodge while on the move. While taking either the Half Move or Full Move Actions, opponents suffer a -20 penalty to all Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit him with ranged weapons. This penalty continues until the start of the Explorer's next Turn.\n\nHARDY\nPrerequisites: Toughness 40\nThe Explorer's constitution rebounds quickly from shock and trauma. When undergoing medical treatment or natural healing after being Lightly Wounded or more severely damaged, the Explorer may re-roll failed Toughness Tests."

      "text": "HATRED\nTalent Groups: Criminals, Heretics, Mutants, Pirates, Xenos (specific), etc.\nThe Explorer bears deep animosity towards a specific organization or race that has wronged him in the past. When attacking members or representatives of that group, he gains a +10 bonus to any Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests made to harm them.\n\nHEAVY WEAPON TRAINING\nTalent Groups: Basic, Las, Launcher, Melta, Plasma, SP\nThe Explorer has received Heavy Weapon Training and may fire weapons of the chosen type without penalty. Heavy weapons are heavy battlefield weapons that can demolish multiple foes and vehicles with a single shot. The Universal Talent group includes proficiency with all weapons with the Heavy Trait.\n\nHEIGHTENED SENSES\nTalent Groups: Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch\nNature or augmentation has enhanced one of the Explorer's senses. When making a Perception Test specifically involving this sense, the Explorer gains a +10 bonus to the Test. Heightened Sense (Sight) would apply to Perception Tests simply using his eyes. Similarly, it would not apply to a Ballistic Skill Test with any ranged weapon.\n\nHIP SHOOTING\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 40, Agility 30\nThe Explorer's prowess with ranged weapons enables him to fire accurately while moving without using the sights. As a Half Action, the character may both move and make a single attack with any ranged weapon. This attack can only be a single shot, not a Semi-Auto or Full Auto burst, and counts as a Half Action.\n\nHOTSHOT PILOT\nPrerequisites: Any Pilot Skill, Agility 40\nThe Explorer's instincts and reflexes when piloting vehicles exceed normal pilots by a wide margin. When using this Talent, the Explorer adds his Agility Bonus to the selected Pilot Skill Test. The character must select either Pilot (Personal), Pilot (Flyers), or Pilot (Space Craft), and receives this benefit only with that specific Pilot Skill.\n\nIMPROVED WARP SENSE\nPrerequisites: Navigator Only\nThe veils between realspace and warp are thin to the Explorer, allowing him to see both the warp and physical universe side by side. The Explorer gains a +10 bonus to Psyniscience Tests and a +10 bonus to Navigation (Warp) Tests. Taking this Talent adds +1 to the character's Psy Rating.\n\nINDEPENDENT TARGETING\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 40\nThe Explorer has developed his peripheral vision and situational awareness when firing two weapons at a time. He suffers only a -10 penalty instead of a -20 penalty when using two ranged weapons against different targets.\n\nINFUSED KNOWLEDGE\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 40\nThe Explorer has been infused with a great wealth of lore and knowledge through mystical rituals, cortical interfaces, or simple persistent brainwashing. This affects the Explorer's Common Lore and Forbidden Lore Skills. The Explorer may treat untrained Advanced Skills as Basic Skills (halving the governing Characteristic) for any Lore Skill for which he is not already trained.\n\nINTO THE JAWS OF HELL\nPrerequisites: Iron Discipline\nThe Explorer's ability to inspire loyalty and devotion has risen to the point where they would follow him into the Warp itself. When the character makes a successful Command Test to motivate people under his command, they gain immunity to Fear and Pinning for a number of Rounds equal to his Fellowship Bonus.\n\nINSPIRE WRATH\nPrerequisites: Fellowship 40\nThrough ancient litanies, violent rhetoric, and awesome presence, the Explorer can inspire hatred and righteous anger against a specified target. As a Full Action, the Explorer can motivate a number of individuals equal to his Fellowship Bonus. This Talent can be combined with others for a truly furious mob. The number of listeners affected can only be a single unit.\n\nIRON DISCIPLINE\nPrerequisites: Willpower 40, Command\nImperial military leaders motivate through iron resolve rather than through kindness. His stalwart example and stern gaze emboldens his men when they falter. If the character is visible to his followers either in person or via pict-caster, they may re-roll failed Willpower Tests. Iron Discipline affects a number of targets equal to the character's Willpower Bonus under his command. The character with this Talent is the officer of the group leading the boarding action (see page 215).\n\nIRON JAW\nPrerequisite: Toughness 40\nThe Explorer's tough constitution and iron jaw allow him to bounce back from blows that would stagger a normal person. After a successful Toughness Test, the Explorer ignores the effects of Stunning or Stunning Critical Hits (see page 250).\n\nJADED\nPrerequisite: Willpower 30\nThe Explorer has experienced so many horrors that little shakes his resolve. The galaxy has thrown its worst at him, and outrageous alien death machinery and xenos abominations will not cause the character moral distress anymore. The Explorer is unaffected by situations that would otherwise inflict a Fear point and gains a +10 bonus to any Tests to resist gaining Insanity Points.\n\nLEAP UP\nPrerequisites: Agility 30\nThrough a combination of athletic ability and training, the Explorer can spring to his feet in virtually any circumstance. Taking a Free Action, the Explorer may stand up from being prone."

      "text": "LIGHTNING ATTACK\nPrerequisites: Swift Attack\nThe Explorer's world with weapons is legendary, allowing him to strike even more opponents as a Full Action. The character may make a number of attacks with a melee weapon equal to his Weapon Skill Bonus divided by 2 (round up). When making a Lightning Attack with only one of his weapons, he does not suffer the normal -10 penalty. When wielding two weapons, if he has the Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee) and Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic) Talents, he may make a Lightning Attack with the melee weapon and a simple attack with the pistol.\n\nLIGHTNING REFLEXES\nPrerequisites: Agility 40\nThe Explorer's enhanced nervous system and combat experience allows him to react quickly when needed. The character adds his Agility Bonus when rolling for Initiative Tests. This may supplement his natural Agility side of the Initiative roll.\n\nLITANY OF HATE\nPrerequisites: Hatred (Any)\nThe Explorer's beliefs in the righteous nature of his cause allow him to inspire others in his crusade.

His ability to focus on combat stratagems provides him with strong tactical vision. Using his Reaction for the Round, the character may make a Tech-Use Test to add +10 to his Weapon Skill Test and Ballistic Skill Test until the end of his next Turn. The Explorer may use this Talent with both armed and unarmed attacks.\n\nLUMINEN BLAST\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer can channel the energy stored within his omni-consecrated bones of his arms. By reciting a canticle prayer to the Omnissiah, he channels the energy stored in his Potentia Coil down these channels and directs it at a target. An enemy target takes 1d10 plus the Explorer's Intelligence Bonus in Energy Damage with the Shocking quality. The Explorer must make a successful Toughness Test when using this Talent or gain 1 level of Fatigue.\nTalent Use: Half Action Attack\n\nLUMINEN CHARGE\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer can channel the sacred energy of his consecrated mechanical systems into weapons, flesh, or tools, allowing him to renew power through his internal coils. The quantity of the machine spirit energy depends on the quirkiness of the Omnissiah. The Explorer can recharge any of the following items with a Hard (-20) Tech-Use Test:\n\nPower Pack: Small Arms (Las, Plasma, Melta) - Average (+0)\nCharge Pack: Basic Weapons - Challenging (-10)\nPower Pack: Servo-skull, Servitor - Hard (-20)\nMachine Spirit: Xenos Tech - Very Hard (-30)\n\nMost systems are imbued with the blessing of the Omnissiah; some systems are either too large or too alien to work with this Talent. The GM will indicate when such a blessing might be impossible.\n\nLUMINEN SHOCK\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer channels power through his Potentia Coil, flowing through his induction field and allowing him to channel this power into contact weapons. A successful Weapon Skill Test or Grapple delivers a deadly shock. The Luminen Shock inflicts 1d10+3 Energy Damage with the Shocking quality. The Explorer suffers 1 level of Fatigue when using this ability if he fails a Toughness Test.\nTalent Use: Half Action Attack\n\nMACHINATOR ARRAY\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer has refined the secrets of the Mechanicus to craft protective shields into his existing cybernetics. As a Half Action, he activates his Machinator Array. Until his next Turn, he reduces any penalties suffered from carrying a damaged limb by half. While the Machinator Array is active, the Explorer's Strength and Toughness Characteristics are increased by +10, and his Agility and Fellowship are decreased by -10. While activated, he halves all movement during any Half Action that also uses a combat action or any Ballistic Skill weapon attack.\n\nMAGLEV GRACE\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer has magnetic induction coils throughout his skeleton that grant him buoyancy and freedom of motion. As a Free Action, the character can reduce falling distances by a number of metres equal to his Toughness Bonus. After a Half Action, the character can accelerate along the ground at a rate of 1d10 plus his Toughness Bonus metres. This movement does not count as running when falling or moving normally. He can turn when in the air but the Maglev Grace requires the Explorer's Potentia Coil to have been recharged.\n\nMAGLEV TRANSCENDENCE\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants, Maglev Grace\nThe Explorer has truly mastered his magnetic induction coils. As a Half Action each Round, the Explorer may fly at a rate of 2d10 plus his Toughness Bonus metres in any direction. He can maintain this rate for a number of Rounds equal to his Toughness Bonus. Each minute he uses this Talent, he depletes 5% of his Potentia Coil.\n\nMARKSMAN\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 35\nThe Explorer's steady hand and eagle eye makes him more accurate at long range. The character halves ranged penalties for either ranged or melee weapons at Long Range and Extreme Range. When fighting at Short Range with a pistol, he suffers no range penalties."

By spending one Hour in Meditation, the Explorer can remove a number of Fatigue levels equal to his Willpower Bonus.\n\nMELEE WEAPON TRAINING\nTalent Groups: Primitive, Universal\nThe Explorer has received Melee Weapon Training and may wield close-combat weapons of the chosen type without penalty. The Universal group includes proficiency with most close-combat melee weapons including Primitive, Chain, Shock, Power weapons, and allows proficient handling of all such weapons. When selecting Melee Weapon Training Talent for the second time, it must be in a different category than previously selected or the Explorer does not benefit from any relevant Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nMIGHTY SHOT\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 40\nThe Explorer has learned to focus his damage where it will do the most harm. His training and abilities allow the Explorer to maximize the value of a shot. When using Mighty Shot with a ranged weapon, the Explorer deals maximum damage for the weapon's base damage.\n\nMIMICRY\nPrerequisites: Agility 40, Fellowship 30\nThe Explorer's facility with language, voice, and physiology gives him an uncanny ability to copy the voice, languages, or mannerisms of another person. He may re-roll failed Scrutiny Tests when using Mimicry. Though Mimicry can be used by vox or similar comm-unit rather than in-person imitation, a Difficult (-10) Scrutiny Test to deceive listeners is still required. Failing the Scrutiny Test automatically fails if the listener has met the actual person being copied.\n\nNAVIGATOR\nThe Explorer was born with the Navigator Gene, either of the Nobilite or shadowed within the unlicensed hidden lineages, allowing him to understand the ebbs and flows of the empyrean. The character gains the Navigator powers outlined in Chapter VIII: Navigator Powers and Special Traits.\n\nNAVIGATOR POWER\nPrerequisites: Navigator Only\nThe Explorer has mastery over one Navigator Power. This Talent enables the selection points within the Navigator Powers. See Chapter VIII: Navigator Powers for a complete listing of Navigator Powers.\n\nNERVES OF STEEL\nPrerequisites: Willpower 30\nThe horrors of the battlefield enable the Explorer to remain calm in the face of death and despair. He may re-roll failed Willpower Tests while in combat.\n\nORTHOPROXY\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants, Tech-Use\nA surgically modified circuit remaps the brain patterns in the Explorer's skull, allowing him to communicate with Tech-Priests and Machine Spirits with greater ease. When making any Tech-Use Test for artifacts, the Explorer receives a +10 bonus to such Tests. Players Fated by the Machine God may use this Talent when their mental fortitude is at risk during psychic manipulation.\n\nPARANOIA\nThe Explorer senses that danger lurks round every corner. The Explorer makes secret Perception Tests during game sessions to detect hidden threats. The price of his eternal vigilance and hair-trigger reflexes is the character gains a permanent -10 penalty to all Fellowship Tests.\n\nPEER\nPrerequisites: Fellowship 30\nTalent Groups: Academic, Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Government, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Law, Military, Middle Classes, Navis Nobilite, Nobility, Underworld, Void Born, Workers\n\nThe Explorer has a natural affinity when dealing with a particular social group.

The price of his eternal vigilance and hair-trigger reflexes is the character gains a permanent -10 penalty to all Fellowship Tests.\n\nPOLYGLOT\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 40, Fellowship 30\nThe Explorer's mind contains the linguistic matrix of countless cultures. He can decipher unknown languages and make himself understood using this base knowledge. The character gains +20 bonus to Linguistics Skills. This is not the same as knowledge of the language, but when using this Talent, the Explorer does not have to use Literacy when translating purely oral communications.\n\nPRECISE BLOW\nPrerequisite: Sure Strike\nThe Explorer's eye and hand act seamlessly together, the blow going exactly where the attacker intends. When making a Called Shot with a melee weapon, the Explorer adds +10 to his Weapon Skill Test and adds his Intelligence Bonus to the number rolled on any Critical Effect table.\n\nPSYCHIC DISCIPLINE\nTalent Groups: Inner Path, Metamorph, Psyker\nThe Explorer receives a +10 bonus to all Focus Power Tests involving a specific Discipline, and effectively raises his Psy Rating by 1 when using powers from this Discipline. The Explorer may study and unlock a new Psychic Discipline from the list in Chapter VI: Psychic Powers.\n\nPSYCHIC TECHNIQUE\nTalent Groups: See Psychic Technique\nThe Explorer chooses one Psychic Technique to master from the list of Techniques. Once the Talent is selected, the Explorer gains the effects of the chosen Psychic Technique; this cannot be changed, though the Explorer may purchase the Talent multiple times to learn different Techniques. Note that when purchasing this Talent, the Explorer must already have a Psy Rating of at least 1. The Explorer may purchase this Talent multiple times, selecting a different Technique each time. Note that selection means additional Techniques cannot be selected later.\n\nPURE FAITH\nThe Explorer's faith in the God-Emperor of Mankind is complete; his faith a manifest and compelling force. Pure Faith grants a number of Faith Points equal to 1d10 plus the Explorer's Willpower Bonus. These points can be spent in the following ways:\n\nThe Explorer may spend a Faith Point to gain a re-roll on any Test.\n\nThe Explorer may spend a Faith Point to negate any Corruption Points gained.\n\nThe Explorer may spend a Faith Point to reduce all damage from a single daemonic or psychic attack to 1 point, effectively allowing the Explorer to emerge unscathed with little more than a scratch.\n\nDuring combat, the Explorer may use neither the Autosanguine nor Prosanguine Talents.\n\nPROSANGUINE\nPrerequisites: Autosanguine, Medicae\nThrough special modifications to his sanguine implants, the Explorer can send the grace of the Omnissiah through his blood to transfuse and augment another. After making a successful Tech-Use Test, the Explorer may restore 1d5 points of Damage to an ally. If he fails, the character suffers 1 level of Fatigue from the effects of responding to an incompatible sanguine mix. These safeguards remain for the duration of the encounter.\n\nPSY RATING\nThe Explorer can focus his psychic power. This Talent represents the strength of his psychic abilities and powers. A character's Psy Rating ranges from 1-10, where Psy Rating 1 represents a psyker who has drawn the attention of the Scholastica Psykana and the Black Ships, and 10 represents one of the most powerful psykers of the entire Imperium. For each time the character purchases this Talent, he increases his Psy Rating by 1.\n\nPURGE THE UNCLEAN\nPrerequisites: Pure Faith\nThe Explorer can focus his faith through words and gestures to drive back the forces of the unclean. As a Half Action, the Explorer may focus his attention on a daemonic foe. Make an opposed Willpower Test. If the Explorer succeeds, the daemon is repelled, driven back a distance equal to twice his Willpower Bonus in metres. The daemon cannot come closer than this distance for 2d5 Rounds. As a Full Action, the Explorer may let out a holy Litany while brandishing his symbol of Faith (a weapon or medallion). All daemons within the Explorer's Willpower Bonus in metres, or who can hear his Righteous Fury (see page 245), must make a successful Willpower Test or suffer a Fear effect. The GM may adjust the effects of this power to reflect daemon-tainted creatures and the character's Pure Faith.\n\nQUICK DRAW\nThe Explorer practices with his weapons frequently. They practically sit in his hands, ready to use at a moment's notice. He may draw a weapon (pistol, basic weapon, melee weapon) as a Free Action when armed with a pistol, basic, or melee weapon that can be wielded in one hand. The explorer can Quickdraw the weapon while making another attack.\n\nRAPID REACTION\nPrerequisites: Agility 40\nThe Explorer has had combat augmentation or natural enhancements allowing him to react super-humanly fast in combat. The Explorer may take an additional Reaction per Round; however, the character suffers a -10 penalty to each subsequent Reaction."

      "text": "RAPID RELOAD\nThe Explorer practices aboard his vessel to reload his weapon with ease. He can exchange power cells for his weapon with speed and accuracy. Recharging or changing ammunition becomes a Half Action instead of a Full Action (representing the time it ordinarily takes to reload a weapon).\n\nRENOWNED WARRANT\nThe Explorer's Trade and Commercial dealings have brought him before the right clerks and scribes. They have taken special interest in his warrant, making his Imperial Warrant the legendary piece of parchment that traders prefer. When dealing with Imperial citizens for common goods, the character receives a +10 bonus against anyone with a Peer rating less than the character's Profit Factor.\n\nRESISTANCE\nTalent Groups: Cold, Disease, Fear, Poison, Psychic Powers\nThe Explorer's background or experiences have toughened him against a particular type of hardship or environmental factor. The Explorer receives a +10 bonus when making Tests to resist the chosen Talent Group. For example, Resistance (Poison) grants the Explorer a +10 bonus to Tests made to resist toxic substances.\n\nRITE OF AWE\nPrerequisites: Explorator\nThe Omnissiah has mechanically blessed the Explorer's voice box, allowing him to release frightening electronic harmonics that trigger fear responses in certain organics and control patterns in others. For a Full Action, the Explorer can cause all humans within his Intelligence Bonus in metres to become affected by the Fear trait. Responding through powerful sub-sonic waves and electronic noise, the character must make a Willpower Test. While using the rite, the Explorer ignores attacks of others. Failing the Test means the Explorer takes damage equal to his Toughness Bonus. This rite requires one minute of intoning special mantras. Characters who have taken damage by this method receive a bonus to Fear Tests equal to the Explorer's Toughness Bonus. Explorers with Iron Jaw are immune to this effect.\n\nRITE OF FEAR\nPrerequisites: Explorator\nThe Explorer's intonations drive away the weak. All characters—both friend and foe—within a 10-metre radius must make a Willpower Test while the Explorer is speaking without interruption. Allies without Iron Jaw become affected by the Fear trait until the chanting stops. The rite requires 10 minutes of chanting without interruption.\n\nRITE OF PURE THOUGHT\nPrerequisites: Explorator\nThe Explorer has replaced the emotive half of his brain with a cogitator circuit. He is immune to emotion and mental manipulation. The character ignores all Fear and Pinning effects from psychic powers, combat, or environmental situations. The Explorer's flesh remains but his eyes are closed to surrounding emotional concerns. The normal mental concerns that plague his fellow Explorers no longer apply, and the character feels neither anger nor joy when going about his duties. An Explorer who has undergone the Rite of Pure Thought may better resist psychic manipulation at the cost of his personality.\n\nRITE OF SANCTIONING\nPrerequisites: Navigator\nThe Explorer has been brought before the Emperor and received an indoctrination of his awesome strength, making the character immune to the predations of the immaterium. The character makes a Willpower Test when first learning this Talent. If the Explorer rolls three or more Degrees of Success, he is forever controlled. Those who fail to gain three Degrees of Success are sometimes unable to complete the rite and are executed by the illuminati. The GM determines further effects based on the character.\n\nRIVAL\nTalent Group: Academic, Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Astra Telepathica, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Government, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Imperial Nobility, Military, Middle Class, Navigators, Nobility, Rogue Traders, Veterans, Void Born, Workers, or Underworld.\n\nThe Explorer has some connection with a long-time antagonist or competitor with a similar background. When interacting with this rival group, the Explorer suffers a -10 penalty to Fellowship Tests. For example, a Void-master with rival Eldar corsair would suffer a -10 penalty to Fellowship Tests when interacting with his rival. The GM and player may alter this Talent as the storyline progresses. This Talent may be removed with the approval of the GM if the player has dealt with the rival in some well-justified manner."

In this case, note the number of times it has been taken after the Talent, such as Sound Constitution (2).\n\nSPRINT\nThe Explorer's terrific pace outruns even his comrades. When taking the Full Move Action, the character may move an additional number of metres equal to his Agility Bonus. When taking the Run Action, he may double his distance traveled for one Round. The Explorer gains 1 level of Fatigue if he uses this Talent two times in a row.\n\nSTEP ASIDE\nPrerequisite: Agility 40, Dodge\nThe Explorer can twist his body out of the path of blows, shots that cut through thin air. He may use an additional Reaction per Round, allowing him two Reactions in all, but can only use this second Reaction to Dodge against one attack.\n\nSTRONG MINDED\nPrerequisite: Willpower 30, Psy Rating 1 (Psychic Techniques)\nThe Explorer's mind forms a fortress against attack. He may re-roll failed Willpower Tests to resist Psychic Techniques that affect his mind. Psychic Techniques that have physical effects such as Telekinesis are unaffected by this Talent.\n\nSHARPSHOOTER\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill 40, Deadeye Shot\nThe Explorer's steady hand and eagle eye allow him to place shots exactly where he wants them. When making a Called Shot, he adds the relevant bonus from Deadeye Shot Talent and reduces his penalty by one step, from Very Hard (-30) to Hard (-20), from Hard (-20) to Challenging (-10), or from Challenging (-10) to Ordinary (+0).\n\nSURE STRIKE\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 30\nThe Explorer can direct his blows far better than most, giving him greater control over where they land. When determining the location of a successful melee attack, he can choose to move the dice result up or down the Hit Location chart by 10 (or less). For example, if an Explorer fighting an Eldar corsair would ordinarily strike the Right Leg (73), by applying his Sure Strike Talent, he could choose to hit the Body (37).\n\nSWIFT ATTACK\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 35\nThe Explorer's natural ability allows him to land multiple blows in rapid succession. As a Full Action, he can make two melee attacks with the same weapon. If he has the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent and is wielding two melee weapons, he gets the advantage of a Swift Attack with only one weapon; he does not incur the normal -10 penalty. When wielding a melee weapon and a pistol, if he has the Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee) and Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic) Talents, he may make a Swift Attack with the melee weapon and a simple attack with the pistol.\n\nTAKEDOWN\nAs a Full Action, the Explorer may declare a Takedown against an opponent, making a Weapon Skill Test. If he hits and would normally deal damage, he may choose to ignore the Damage roll and instead make an Opposed Strength Test. If successful, the target is knocked Prone and Stunned for one Round; if failed, the target remains standing. Performing this special attack does not suffer the -20 penalty to the Weapon Skill Test incurred for a Called Shot. This Takedown counts as dealing Damage for the purposes of Reactions."

The Universal Group includes proficiency with most primitive thrown weapons such as throwing knives, axes, spears, darts, etc. When selecting Thrown Weapon Training Talent for the second time, it must be in a different category than previously selected or the Explorer does not benefit from any relevant Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nTALENTED\nTalent Group: Any skill\nThe Explorer has a natural aptitude for a chosen skill and gains a +10 bonus on all Tests made using that Skill.\n\nTECHNICAL KNOCK\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 30\nEither through the use of long practice, proper ritual, or a manufacturer's quirk, the Explorer can clear jammed weapons with uncanny success. As a Half Action, he can attempt to clear a jammed weapon. After a successful Intelligence Test, the weapon is cleared for one Round and operates without further jamming for that round.\n\nTOTAL RECALL\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 30\nMental conditioning or genetic quirk grants the Explorer a portrait-perfect memory. He can effectively print memories, automatically remembering names, dates, places, and pieces of information that might otherwise require an Intelligence Test. For example, he could recall the deck plans of a starship, security patrols on a space hulk complex, or images in a pictograph. The GM may occasionally make a secret Intelligence Test to determine if he can recall a particularly complex or faded memory.\n\nTHE EMPEROR PROTECTS\nPrerequisites: Pure Faith\nThe Emperor's watchful eye prevents harm from befalling the faithful and emboldens the righteous. By spending a Fate Point, the character grants himself and a number of allies equal to his Willpower Bonus immunity to the effects of Fear and Pinning for the duration of the encounter. The character must speak words of devotion and prayer while spending his Fate Point to trigger these protective effects, allowing the targeted ally to regain his nerve and continue fighting despite overwhelming odds. An Explorer with this Talent is considered a holy man within the church.\n\nTRUE GRIT\nPrerequisites: Willpower 40\nA warrior of wounds that would fell lesser men, the Explorer may continue to fight when Critically Damaged. Make a Willpower Test when suffering Critical Damage; each Degree of Success allows the Explorer to ignore the penalties from his wounds for one Round.\n\nTWO-WEAPON WIELDER\nTalent Groups: Ballistic, Melee\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill or Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35\nThe Explorer can fight effectively while armed with two weapons of the same type. As a Full Action, he can make a single attack with each weapon. However, he suffers a -20 penalty to hit with both weapons. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more details on fighting with two weapons. He must purchase both Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee) and Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic) to use a pistol and hand weapon with this Talent.\n\nTHE FLESH IS WEAK\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer's body contains so many machine parts and bionic replacements that he is more machine than man at this point. This Talent grants the Explorer the Machine Trait (see page 363), with Armour Points equal to half his Toughness Bonus (rounded up), which stacks with worn armour. The Explorer may purchase this Talent multiple times in accordance with his Career Path Advances. In this case, note the number of times The Flesh is Weak has been taken.\n\nUNARMED MASTER\nPrerequisites: Unarmed Warrior\nThe Explorer is a true combat monster whose unarmed combat attacks do 1d10+SB damage and gain the Primitive quality.\n\nUNARMED WARRIOR\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35\nThe Explorer dominates unarmed combat; his unarmed combat attacks do 1d5+SB damage, and he does not suffer the -10 penalty for unarmed attacks in melee.

After a successful Intelligence Test, the weapon is cleared for one Round and operates without further jamming for that round.\n\nTOTAL RECALL\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 30\nMental conditioning or genetic quirk grants the Explorer a portrait-perfect memory. He can effectively print memories, automatically remembering names, dates, places, and pieces of information that might otherwise require an Intelligence Test. For example, he could recall the deck plans of a starship, security patrols on a space hulk complex, or images in a pictograph. The GM may occasionally make a secret Intelligence Test to determine if he can recall a particularly complex or faded memory.\n\nTHE EMPEROR PROTECTS\nPrerequisites: Pure Faith\nThe Emperor's watchful eye prevents harm from befalling the faithful and emboldens the righteous. By spending a Fate Point, the character grants himself and a number of allies equal to his Willpower Bonus immunity to the effects of Fear and Pinning for the duration of the encounter. The character must speak words of devotion and prayer while spending his Fate Point to trigger these protective effects, allowing the targeted ally to regain his nerve and continue fighting despite overwhelming odds. An Explorer with this Talent is considered a holy man within the church.\n\nTRUE GRIT\nPrerequisites: Willpower 40\nA warrior of wounds that would fell lesser men, the Explorer may continue to fight when Critically Damaged. Make a Willpower Test when suffering Critical Damage; each Degree of Success allows the Explorer to ignore the penalties from his wounds for one Round.\n\nTWO-WEAPON WIELDER\nTalent Groups: Ballistic, Melee\nPrerequisites: Ballistic Skill or Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35\nThe Explorer can fight effectively while armed with two weapons of the same type. As a Full Action, he can make a single attack with each weapon. However, he suffers a -20 penalty to hit with both weapons. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more details on fighting with two weapons. He must purchase both Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee) and Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic) to use a pistol and hand weapon with this Talent.\n\nTHE FLESH IS WEAK\nPrerequisites: Mechanicus Implants\nThe Explorer's body contains so many machine parts and bionic replacements that he is more machine than man at this point. This Talent grants the Explorer the Machine Trait (see page 363), with Armour Points equal to half his Toughness Bonus (rounded up), which stacks with worn armour. The Explorer may purchase this Talent multiple times in accordance with his Career Path Advances. In this case, note the number of times The Flesh is Weak has been taken.\n\nUNARMED MASTER\nPrerequisites: Unarmed Warrior\nThe Explorer is a true combat monster whose unarmed combat attacks do 1d10+SB damage and gain the Primitive quality.\n\nUNARMED WARRIOR\nPrerequisites: Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35\nThe Explorer dominates unarmed combat; his unarmed combat attacks do 1d5+SB damage, and he does not suffer the -10 penalty for unarmed attacks in melee. In addition, the Explorer adds his Strength Bonus to the damage he deals with both armed and unarmed attacks."

In addition, the Explorer adds his Strength Bonus to the damage he deals with both armed and unarmed attacks when making melee attacks against prone opponents.\n\nUNREMARKABLE\nThe Explorer's appearance is eerily forgettable and ordinary. Guards challenged to describe him will often struggle to recall exact details. By adopting a mannered anonymity and dressing to avoid notice, the character becomes difficult to remember. When reconsidering a social encounter, witnesses receive a -10 penalty to any Perception Tests to recall details about the Explorer's features.\n\nUNSHAKABLE FAITH\nSuch is the Explorer's confidence in the Emperor that he is rarely in danger. He may re-roll any failed Willpower Tests to avoid the effects of Fear when invoking his faith.\n\nVOID TACTICIAN\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 40\nThe Explorer's ability to conceptualize three-dimensional space gives him a significant advantage in starship combat. He gains a +10 bonus to Command Skill Tests made during starship combat involving maneuvers or tactical actions.\n\nWALL OF STEEL\nPrerequisites: Agility 30\nAny time while the Explorer is engaged in melee combat, he may use his secondary weapon or shield to guard against incoming attacks. He may make one additional Parry Reaction per Round. He may only attempt to parry using a single weapon that Round.\n\nWARP AFFINITY\nPrerequisites: Psy Rating 2\nThe Explorer has a special connection to the Warp, allowing him to control its less desirable effects. When using this Talent in conjunction with powers that have undergone the Rite of Sanctioning, he becomes immune to Warp Influence while using psychic powers. When rolling Psychic Phenomena, the Explorer may discard the die roll, suffering 1d5 Corruption Points, and reroll on the Psychic Phenomena table.\n\nWARP CONDUIT\nPrerequisites: Psy Rating 3, Strong Minded, Willpower 40\nThe sheer power of the Explorer's mind allows him to channel greater Warp energy without burning out. The Explorer receives a +10 bonus to his Psy Rating when a resultant Psychic Phenomenon falls below half the harm it would normally cause. In effect, this makes the Explorer's ability to resist maleficaria more powerful and stable.\n\nWARP SENSE\nPrerequisites: Navigator, Psyniscience Skill\nThe Explorer's eye perceives the ebb and flow of the warp in parallel with material space. After gaining this Talent, using the Psyniscience Skill requires only a Half Action instead of a Full Action.\n\nWHISPERS\nPrerequisites: Intelligence 45, Fellowship 30\nSuch is the Explorer's reputation that information comes unbidden to him. His network of informants across the fleet ensures he is never the last to learn of strange occurrences or any danger. He may re-roll failed Intelligence Tests to learn what happened aboard ship, and his contacts no longer keep secrets from him. The Explorer receives a +10 bonus to Skill Tests for Investigation or Inquiry Skills.\n\nWRATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS\nPrerequisites: Pure Faith\nThe Explorer can unleash his righteous fury on those who defy Him on the Golden Throne, that which is sacred, and that which is holy. When making an attack, the Explorer may spend a Faith Point to trigger Righteous Fury on a single successful attack. The attack automatically deals the maximum effect possible for the weapon plus 1d10 points of Damage. If the attack dice results in a 10, further Righteous Fury may apply (see Righteous Fury, page 245)."

      "text": "CHAPTER V:\nARMOURY\n\n\"There are two things a warrior needs to succeed in battle—the blessing of the God-Emperor and a cache of decent weapons. When facing the unknown terrors that prey upon the Calixis Sector, not to mention the new threats unimaginined beyond the edges, Explorers entering the Koronus Expanse had better be properly equipped. The better their chances against the host of deranged psykers and unleashed daemons stalking the stars.\"\n—Rogue Trader Cassilus Preem\n\nThe Lord-Captain's Dynasty has a hold upon many worlds whose markets offer goods ranging from standard munitions to heretical and xenos-tainted artifacts. The Explorer must be ready for anything when far from the protection of Imperial power.\n\nAVAILABILITY AND EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGY\nSome items are common across the Imperium. For instance, las weapons can be found on nearly any world with a population of more than a few thousand. Difficult equipment, on the other hand, can be found only on more populous worlds or on worlds where technology is particularly prevalent. The GM can adjust the Difficulty based on recent historical events or market conditions.\n\nAVAILABILITY AND TIME\nMost market exchanges occur immediately. The Rogue Trader concludes a bargain with a merchant and receives the item right away. However, sometimes a purchase must be sought out. Communities with fewer than 100,000 people offer less selection and choice than communities with larger populations. Communities better than 1,000 people contain a greater variety of merchants and guilders, while communities larger than 100,000 people often contain entire merchant guilds tasked with fulfilling individual contracts from the likes of Imperial Governors and Rogue Traders.\n\nSmaller communities or particular requests may involve longer negotiations and placement of contracts before the merchant arrives with the goods. Table 5-2: Availability, Population and Time shows the Difficulty change based on population and the time it would take to complete such a purchase through official channels. If the GM determines that no sellers for the desired item can be found, the Explorer must complete a Commerce Test in order to find acceptable traders. This is usually an Opposed Test, with the Trader matching his Commercial skill against the seller's Commerce Skill.\n\nTABLE 5-1: AVAILABILITY BY POPULATION\nAvailability | Population <100,000 | Population 100,000+\n------------|-------------------|------------------\nUbiquitous | Routine (+20) | Automatic\nAbundant | Ordinary (+10) | Routine (+20)\nPlentiful | Challenging (+0) | Ordinary (+10) \nCommon | Difficult (-10) | Challenging (+0)\nAverage | Hard (-20) | Difficult (-10)\nScarce | Very Hard (-30) | Hard (-20)\nRare | Arduous (-40) | Very Hard (-30)\nVery Rare | - | Arduous (-40)\nExtremely Rare | - | -\nNear Unique | - | -\nUnique | - | -\n\nTABLE 5-2: AVAILABILITY, POPULATION AND TIME\nAvailability | 1 million+ | 100,000-1 million | 10,000-100,000 | 1,000-10,000 | <1,000\n------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|--------\nUbiquitous | 1d5 hours | 1d5 hours | 1d5 hours | 1d10 hours | 1d10 hours\nAbundant | 1d5 hours | 1d5 hours | 1d10 hours | 1d5 days | 1d10 days\nPlentiful | 1d5 hours | 1d10 hours | 1d5 days | 1d10 days | 1 month\nCommon | 1d10 hours | 1d5 days | 1d10 days | 1 month | 3 months\nAverage | 1d5 days | 1d10 days | 1 month | 3 months | 6 months\nScarce | 1d10 days | 1 month | 3 months | 6 months | 1 year\nRare | 1 month | 3 months | 6 months | 1 year | -\nVery Rare | 3 months | 6 months | 1 year | - | -\nExtremely Rare | 6 months | 1 year | - | - | -\nNear Unique | 1 year | - | - | - | -\nUnique | - | - | - | - | -"

      "text": "CRAFTSMANSHIP\nDuring their adventures, Rogue Traders and those who serve them encounter countless lords and nobles practicing their trade—artisans and artificers engaged in developing contacts, establishing compacts, or developing exotic merchandise. The craftsmanship of a particular item often determines how efficiently it functions. In general, craftsmanship affects the time taken to use an item, the likelihood of successful use of the item, or the bonuses it provides when used.\n\nCraftsmanship generally has one of three values: Poor, Common, Good, or Best. When Poor craftsmanship results in negative effects, the GM must determine when these effects might enter play. One step down from Common craftsmanship is considered Poor, while one step up is Good craftsmanship. Best craftsmanship represents items of especially high quality, often family heirlooms or items specially commissioned from the finest artificers of the Imperium and beyond. The GM may also determine that weapons and other items exist of exceptional quality beyond Best, but these are GM discretion.\n\nCraftsmanship affects the time taken to complete an Acquisition, lying between acquiring the purchase paperwork and completing the acquisition itself. Table 5-3: Craftsmanship and Time Taken provides a multiplier for the time values given in Table 5-2: Availability, Population, and Time.\n\nTABLE 5-3: CRAFTSMANSHIP AND TIME TAKEN\nCraftsmanship | Time Taken\n--------------|----------\nPoor | ×0.5\nCommon | ×1\nGood | ×2\nBest | ×5\n\nWEALTH AND ACQUISITIONS\n\"I fear that I do not have such a weapon in stock presently, though I thank you for considering my establishment. Perhaps if Lord Captain d'Orio were to pre-order, we might find something suitable for your Dynasty's needs?\"\n—Markian Velchin, merchant\n\nA Rogue Trader commands the wealth of a thousand worlds. His coffers overflow with coins gathered from countless commercial enterprises across the sector and beyond. His dynasty's reach allows trade with peoples who have not seen humanity in centuries, and he can offer goods produced in industrial quantities or archeotech recovered from forgotten worlds.\n\nWealth is an essential part of what makes a Rogue Trader great. He is responsible for maintaining ancient commercial compacts for centuries, enabling the trade that underpins the Calixis Sector's economy, bringing prosperity to the many worlds along its borders. The Koronus Expanse lies beyond the borders of Imperial space, sometimes deeper yet into the galaxy of the Imperium, and an adept Rogue Trader with sufficient wealth could find and fortify his void-ships for ranging remotely into dangerous space. A crafty Rogue Trader might even amass profit enough to establish colonies on profitable nearby worlds.\n\nCURRENCIES IN THE KORONUS EXPANSE\nCurrency comprises whatever objects are a common unit of exchange in a given locale—precious metals, ephemera, flawless gemstones, cold ingots, skulls plucked from each fallen foe, etc. The economies of the settled worlds of the Calixis Sector and Foundling Worlds close to Port Wander run on Imperial coinage. Arbitrator Reals are small portions of the greater Imperium where officials collect the Imperial Tithe, measured in gems and ores brought to Port Wander by merchants and Rogue Traders.\n\nPrimitive societies vary greatly from place to place. The stonecutters of Damaris Secundus and prospectors of the dead-end Heathen Stars use coin from their variations on the Imperial Seal. Others, such as the survivors of dead colonies in the Unbeholden Reaches, use scraps of jeweled wire weighted with precious metals hung upon loops of silver wire.\n\nSome worlds are still advanced enough for usury, complex trade arrangements, paper currency, and promissory scrip backed by the word of guilds. Many Rogue Trader dynasties employ a standard merit of exchange, contracting with minor houses and offering measure for measure on bonds and retainers. Trade between the Foundling Worlds and pirate kingdoms of the near Koronus Expanse is conducted hesitantly, with all parties bearing arms.\n\nWeaknesses reveal themselves in currency where the dark arts of counterfeiters thrive, while markets teeter on the edge of prices on the decline or rise where the dark arts covertly sway entire communities. Currency is more volatile in the remote and strange, the chaotic interlaced with threats to unseemly travelers. \"Need gets the bitz\" is the saying, though often literally the bitz are the payment.\n\nBy comparison, the secretive Eldar of the Expanse do not employ currencies in the same manner as humanity. Eldar currency is immeasurable by human cognition, employing ethereal patterns hard to perceive with human eyes. However, attempting trade with Eldar is a precarious proposition, with those arrogant knife-eared folk hypercritical and judgmental.\n\nEven more exotic are the Stryxis, who have a monetary system that allows for an unnerving variety. Rogue Trader reports concerning Stryxis bartering sessions describe insane practices and bartering more reminiscent of esoteric mystic ritual than commerce.\n\nTHRONE GELT\nThe concept of Profit Factor and the limits that a Rogue Trader uses these rules to make acquisitions of property and resources are reflected in terms of Throne Gelt, the coin of exchange throughout the Calixis Sector. Imperials, Thrones, Eagles, and Crowns—the names vary by region, but whether locally issued or struck within the halls of Scintilla, they all represent a measure of the Imperium's planetary riches.\n\nAMMUNITION\nWithout ammunition, a gun is just a glorified club, but a Rogue Trader should ensure that the weapons he, his retainers, and his crew use are kept supplied with sufficient ammunition.\n\nThis includes shells for autoguns, rounds for bolt weapons, cartridges for las weapons, fuel for flamer weapons, containment flasks for plasma weapons, quarrels for crossbows, and arrows for bows. Just as the types of weapons contain countless varieties, so do their ammunition and power supplies.\n\nAs a general rule, the Explorer's equipment costs include a built-in supply of the default secure and common ammunition or charge for his weapons.\n\nUPGRADES AND UNUSUAL AMMUNITION\nThere are many varieties of upgrades or more unusual ammunition. See page 271 for more information on acquiring such upgrades or ammunition as part of an Acquisition."

      "text": "WEAPONS\nWhen reading the weapon profiles that follow, there are several abbreviations and special notations to keep in mind.\n\nClass (Class): Describes what type of weapon it is; whether it can be fired one-handed with a Pistol skill, or requires Basic Weapon Training to use properly. Melee weapons can be used in close combat. When using a melee weapon, the hit Characteristic is Weapon Skill, while ranged weapons use Ballistic Skill. Throwing weapons are anything that might be thrown when fully loaded. Pistols can also be used in close combat (though they suffer penalties to hit), but other classes such as Basic require distance to be effective.\n\nRange (Range): This represents how far an effective shot can travel. The first number is the weapon's Short Range in metres. Medium Range is twice this number, while Long Range is three times this number, and Extreme Range is four times this number. Weapons cannot be fired beyond Extreme Range. A weapon's Short Range and Long Range are used to determine various bonuses and penalties. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game, page 247, for more information.\n\nRate of Fire (RoF): This tells you if the weapon can fire in Semi-Auto or Full-Auto mode, and how many shots are fired when doing so. The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly, shown as an S. The second entry describes the number of shots fired when the weapon is fired on Semi-Auto mode; if the weapon cannot be fired in this mode, there will be a dash (-). Finally, the third entry describes if the weapon can be fired on Full-Auto and the number of shots fired when the weapon is fired this way. If the weapon cannot be fired in this mode, it will be indicated with a dash (-). Some weapons can be fired in different modes. If this is the case, each of its different RoF will be listed in its profile, and characters can choose which mode they are firing in before rolling their attack.\n\nDamage (Dam): The damage formula for the weapon. The first number is the base damage (for example, 1d10), followed by a modifier for Penetration and any Critical effects (as shown in the Type column). Types include (E) Energy, (X) Explosive, (R) Rending, and (I) Impact. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more information.\n\nPenetration (Pen): Penetration represents how effectively the weapon pierces armour. Penetration reduces the protective value of Armour Points. Note that Penetration only affects Armour Points the target is wearing; the type of weapon matters little when foes lack protection beyond their fleshy bodies.\n\nClip (Clip): How many shots the weapon carries before needing to reload. Often referred to as \"magazine\" for weapons that have one. A dash indicates that the weapon has effectively unlimited ammunition.\n\nReload (Rld): How many Actions the weapon takes to reload. Generally, this requires a Half Action for simple weapons, while more complex weapons require a Full Action or more. \"2 Full\" means reloading requires two Full Actions. For weapons that use one hand, such as a Pistol, close-combat weapons, or similar items, the Reload characteristic refers to how many Rounds it would take to swap between the weapon and another one-handed object the character has ready.\n\nSpecial (Special): Lists all of the weapon's special qualities or traits that set it apart from other weapons of the same class.\n\nWeight (WT): The weapon's weight in kilograms (kg). Basic guns are bulky and require two hands to fire normally. However, they enjoy a bonus for being full-sized and have less jitter or bounce than small sidearms. For more information on weight and carrying capacity, see Chapter IX: Playing the Game, page 247. Weapons cannot be used in ways that vastly differ from their design or weight class.\n\nAvailability (Avail): This identifies the weapon's rarity. For rules on finding and purchasing equipment, see Table 5-1: Availability by Population on page 132.\n\nA GALAXY OF GUNS\nThe Imperium encompasses a million worlds, each with its own manufactora, forge worlds, and the like. Village artisans and blacksmiths produce countless makes and patterns of weapons. The GM is encouraged to create as many makes and patterns as you see fit; after all, it's nearly impossible for the Imperium to create a truly standardized pattern of weapons across countless worlds.\n\nMany ranged weapons possess a Rate of Fire (RoF) entry that contains either S, Semi-Auto, or Full-Auto. These entries indicate how the weapon can be fired (especially if it can be fired in more than one mode). The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly, shown as an S. The second entry describes the number of shots fired when the weapon is fired on Semi-Auto mode. The third entry defines how many shots are fired when the weapon is fired on Full-Auto mode. If the weapon cannot be fired in this mode, it will be indicated with a dash (-).\n\nWEAPON SPECIAL QUALITIES\nWeapons have a variety of unique traits, from excellent craftsmanship to marvelous manufacture. Use the following modifiers when calculating to deal with unusual weapon special qualities. The following are the most used weapon qualities.\n\nACCURATE\nWeapons with this quality are designed primarily for accuracy, whether they are precision las weapons or long-barreled slugthrowers. These weapons give a +10 bonus to the wielder's Ballistic Skill when the Aiming Action is used. Melee weapons with the Accurate quality provide a +10 bonus to the wielder's Weapon Skill for one attack when the Aiming Action is used in the same Round."

      "pageIndex": 115,
      "text": "BALANCED\nSome weapons, such as swords and knives, are designed with excellent balance and weight. A Balanced weapon takes far less effort to wield than a weapon without such perfect craftsmanship. A Balanced weapon counts as having one less Kilogram of weight when determining whether a character has the Strength required to wield it effectively. Additionally, if the Explorer has the appropriate Weapon Training Talent, he adds +10 to his Weapon Skill Test when making a Standard Attack with a Balanced melee weapon.\n\nBLAST (X)\nMany weapons blast out deadly shrapnel or flames when they hit their target. When working out shots with this quality, they inflict damage to all targets within a number of metres indicated by the number in parenthesis. This blast is centered on the impact point and all individuals within it must succeed on a second Agility Test or be hit. Characters may Dodge to avoid Blast weapon attacks, but cannot Parry them.\n\nProperly armoured characters gain protection from attacks made by Blast weapons. Normally when a weapon with the Blast quality is fired without being aimed, the wielder suffers a penalty of -20 to his Ballistic Skill test. Reloading this weapon counts as requiring a Full Action (or a number of Actions detailed in the weapon's description). If fired while the wielder who does not have the appropriate Weapon Training Talent for the weapon they are wielding is attempting to fire, there is a 25% chance it will jam if the firer fails his Ballistic Skill Test, and take a Full Action to clear.\n\nDEFENSIVE\nMade for parrying, this weapon protects its wielder and wards off incoming attacks. If he uses the Defensive Stance Reaction (See Chapter IX: Playing the Game, page 249), the Explorer receives a +15 bonus to Parry when using these weapons in a Defensive Stance.\n\nFLAME\nFlame Weapons project a cone of flame out to the range of the weapon. Unlike other ranged weapons, Flame weapons do not require a Ballistic Skill Test to hit the target. Instead a Flame weapon affects all targets in a cone out from the character using the weapon to the weapon's maximum range. Anyone affected by the weapon's attack must make a successful Agility Test or be hit. Those who pass their Agility Test have dodged the majority of the flames (though they may still take damage from adjacent flames). Flame weapons are devastating against unarmored targets due to their fiery nature, and they ignore all Toughness Bonuses enemies would normally apply to reduce damage.\n\nFLEXIBLE\nFlexible weapons are basically concealed segments chained together so they can be coiled and hidden. Unlike other weapons, Flexible melee weapons cannot be parried by non-Flexible weapons. The Ballistic Skill Test required to hit with a Flexible ranged weapon such as a whip receives a -10 penalty for each degree of distance beyond the first.\n\nINACCURATE\nWeapons that are either badly designed or simply crude are less likely to hit their targets. No bonus is gained from the Aim Action with this weapon. When used from the hip without aiming, the wielder suffers a -10 penalty to his Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nOVERHEATS\nCertain weapons are prone to overheating either because of poor design or because they fire unstable, superheated ammunition. If the firer misses with an attack, roll a 1d100. On a roll of 91–100, the weapon jams and requires a Full Action to clear. In addition, when used on Semi-Auto or Full-Auto Mode, each shot fired counts as two shots against the clip, potentially doubling the amount of ammunition expended. Weapons with this quality do not receive the Reliable quality if the weapon also has the Flame special quality, increasing the chance of overheating.\n\nPOWER FIELD\nA field of power writhes across weapons with this quality, increasing their Damage and Penetration beyond what is already impressive. When you successfully use a Power weapon, add the weapon's Penetration value to the Damage dealt. Powered melee weapons ignore the protective value of armour to a degree determined by the power field's strength. Each power weapon adds a +4 bonus for every Armour Point the hit location has (up to the weapon's Penetration value).\n\nPRIMITIVE\nCrude in form and basic design, these kinds of weapons, while still effective, impact poorly against modern armours. Armor Points are doubled against weapons with the Primitive quality. When a character with this quality uses a Primitive weapon, a 1d6 roll becomes 1d10 and all other dice mechanics remain the same.\n\nRECHARGE\nBecause of the volatile nature of the weapon's ammunition, the weapon must be Recharged (taking a Full Action) after firing. Recharging involves priming capacitors, loading chambers, and generally making the weapon operable once again.\n\nRELIABLE\nAdvanced technology means Reliable weapons seldom fail. If a Reliable weapon jams, roll 1d10 and only on a result of 1 has it actually jammed. Giving the weapon both the Reliable and the Unreliable special qualities cancels both effects.\n\nSCATTER\nThe standard ammunition of these weapons spreads out when fired. If fired at a foe within Point-Blank range, Scatter weapons gain a +10 bonus to the wielder's Ballistic Skill Test and inflict an additional hit if they strike their target. For every point the Degrees of Success is above 3, the weapon indicates another hit (use Table 9-6: Multiple Hits to work out the effects). Scatter weapons fire a spread of small projectiles, which have limited penetrating power. As such, the weapon's Armor Penetration value counts as half normal (rounded down) when determining whether or not it can pierce armour.\n\nSHOCKING\nThrough power fluctuations integrated into the weapon's strike, it gains the Shocking quality. When you successfully use a weapon with the Shocking special quality, your foe must test Toughness or be Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to half the Damage inflicted (rounding up). Machine spirits are immune to this effect.\n\nSMOKE\nThese weapons throw up a cloud of smoke to obscure vision. When a hit occurs from a weapon with the Smoke quality, it creates a smokescreen at the point of impact. This screen lasts for 2d10 Rounds, or less in adverse weather at the GM's discretion.\n\nSNARE\nWeapons with this quality entangle the target after a successful hit. The target must make an Agility Test or become immobilized. An immobilized target counts as helpless to other attacks. He can attempt to either burst the bonds (a Strength Test) or carefully free himself (an Agility Test). The target is considered helpless until he frees himself. The GM determines how many Tests it may take to break free."

The second entry describes the number of shots fired when the weapon is fired on Semi-Auto mode; if the weapon cannot be fired in this mode, there will be a dash (-). Finally, the third entry describes if the weapon can be fired on Full-Auto and the number of shots fired when the weapon is fired this way. If the weapon cannot be fired in this mode, it will be indicated with a dash (-). Some weapons can be fired in different modes. If this is the case, each of its different RoF will be listed in its profile, and characters can choose which mode they are firing in before rolling their attack.\n\nDamage (Dam): The damage formula for the weapon. The first number is the base damage (for example, 1d10), followed by a modifier for Penetration and any Critical effects (as shown in the Type column). Types include (E) Energy, (X) Explosive, (R) Rending, and (I) Impact. See Chapter IX: Playing the Game for more information.\n\nPenetration (Pen): Penetration represents how effectively the weapon pierces armour. Penetration reduces the protective value of Armour Points. Note that Penetration only affects Armour Points the target is wearing; the type of weapon matters little when foes lack protection beyond their fleshy bodies.\n\nClip (Clip): How many shots the weapon carries before needing to reload. Often referred to as \"magazine\" for weapons that have one. A dash indicates that the weapon has effectively unlimited ammunition.\n\nReload (Rld): How many Actions the weapon takes to reload. Generally, this requires a Half Action for simple weapons, while more complex weapons require a Full Action or more. \"2 Full\" means reloading requires two Full Actions. For weapons that use one hand, such as a Pistol, close-combat weapons, or similar items, the Reload characteristic refers to how many Rounds it would take to swap between the weapon and another one-handed object the character has ready.\n\nSpecial (Special): Lists all of the weapon's special qualities or traits that set it apart from other weapons of the same class.\n\nWeight (Wt): The weapon's weight in kilograms (kg). Basic guns are bulky and require two hands to fire normally. However, they enjoy a bonus for being full-sized and have less jitter or bounce than small sidearms. For more information on weight and carrying capacity, see Chapter IX: Playing the Game, page 247. Weapons cannot be used in ways that vastly differ from their design or weight class.\n\nAvailability (Avail): This identifies the weapon's rarity. For rules on finding and purchasing equipment, see Table 5-1: Availability by Population on page 132.\n\nA GALAXY OF GUNS\nThe Imperium encompasses a million worlds, each with its own manufactora, forge worlds, and the like. Village artisans and blacksmiths produce countless makes and patterns of weapons. The GM is encouraged to create as many makes and patterns as you see fit; after all, it's nearly impossible for the Imperium to create a truly standardized pattern of weapons across countless worlds.\n\nMany ranged weapons possess a Rate of Fire (RoF) entry that contains either S, Semi-Auto, or Full-Auto. These entries indicate how the weapon can be fired (especially if it can be fired in more than one mode). The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly, shown as an S. The second entry describes the number of shots fired when the weapon is fired on Semi-Auto mode. The third entry defines how many shots are fired when the weapon is fired on Full-Auto mode. If the weapon cannot be fired in this mode, it will be indicated with a dash (-)."

      "text": "WEAPON SPECIAL QUALITIES\nWeapons have a variety of unique traits, from excellent craftsmanship to marvelous manufacture. Use the following modifiers when calculating to deal with unusual weapon special qualities. The following are the most used weapon qualities.\n\nWEAPON CRAFTSMANSHIP\nCraftsmanship details how well-constructed a weapon is, whether of Poor, Common, Good, or Best quality. Poor craftsmanship weapons are functionally unreliable; weapons of Poor craftsmanship have the Unreliable quality. Common craftsmanship is average, normal quality with no particular bonuses or penalties. Good craftsmanship weapons are more carefully constructed and consequently more reliable. Ranged weapons of Good craftsmanship have the Reliable quality (if they don't already have this quality, there is no further benefit). Melee weapons of Good craftsmanship add +5 to Weapon Skill Tests made to hit with them.\n\nBest craftsmanship weapons are forged by master craftsmen and highly skilled artisans. Add these bonuses for weapons of Best craftsmanship:\n\nMelee Weapon: +10 to Weapon Skill Tests made to hit with the weapon.\nRanged Weapon: Simply count as a weapon of Best craftsmanship when determining damage, or treat as having Good craftsmanship.\n\nCUSTOMISED\nA weapon that has been rebuilt and fine-tuned for a specific wielder provides a +5 bonus to his Ballistic Skill or Weapon Skill Tests made to hit with it. This effect only applies to the individual for whom it was customised.\n\nTORM\nWeapons with this quality fire in single shots only. Weapons with the Storm quality add +2 to Damage and +1 to Penetration, but require a Recharge time of a Half Action after firing. Normally when a weapon with the Storm quality is fired without being aimed, the wielder suffers a penalty of -20 to his Ballistic Skill test. Reloading this weapon counts as requiring a Full Action (or a number of Actions detailed in the weapon's description). If fired while the wielder does not have the appropriate Weapon Training Talent for the weapon they are wielding is attempting to fire, there is a 25% chance it will jam if the firer fails his Ballistic Skill Test, and take a Full Action to clear.\n\nUNSTABLE\nTechnological limits mean these weapons fire ammunition that is both volatile and unpredictable. When an Unstable Weapon scores a hit, roll 1d10. On a score of 9 or 10, the weapon inflicts only half normal Damage and Penetration. On any other result, it inflicts twice the normal Damage and Penetration.\n\nUSING WEAPONS WITHOUT TALENT\nMany of the weapons described in this chapter require appropriate Talents to be used effectively. Lacking the requisite Weapon Training Talent, the character employs it at a -20 penalty to his Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test. In addition, when using a ranged weapon for which he does not have the proper Talent (or a melee weapon with the Balanced quality), the wielder suffers a -10 penalty to hit. When the weapon has the Flame quality or other special quality where an Agility Test might avoid its effects, targets gain a +10 bonus to their Agility Tests to avoid being hit.\n\nDropping the Weapon: A wielder inexperienced with a particular weapon is more likely to drop it if he suffers damage. When wielding a weapon for which he does not have the appropriate Talent, he must make a Challenging (-10) Strength Test whenever he suffers Damage. Failure indicates he has dropped the weapon.\n\nUnreliable: All weapons without the Reliable quality become Unreliable in the hands of an untrained wielder. On a natural roll of 91 or higher, the weapon jams. Clearing the jam is a Full Action."

      "text": "STORM\nWeapons with this quality fire in single shots only. When firing a weapon with the Storm quality, the wielder receives a +2 bonus to Damage and +1 to Penetration. On a successful hit, the weapon deals an additional hit (up to a maximum of three total). Reduce the weapon's Clip by one for each additional hit.\n\nTEARING\nWeapons with this quality use some form of fast-moving, razor-sharp teeth that rip into flesh and bone. These weapons roll two dice for Damage and pick the highest result.\n\nTOXIC\nWeapons with this quality either contain or are coated with some form of poison, toxin, or acid. When they successfully strike an organic target, the foe must make a Toughness Test or suffer additional effects. Reduce the target's Toughness by 10 for each point of Damage after reduction for Armour. Every Degree of Failure indicates there is an additional 1d10 points of Damage inflicted.\n\nTWIN-LINKED\nSeveral weapons have been connected together to fire at the same time. Divide the Rate of Fire for this weapon's profile in half to determine how many shots are fired, but roll to hit with each one separately. A twin-linked weapon counts as having the Reliable quality.\n\nUNBALANCED\nCumbersome and awkward after striking, these kinds of weapons leave the wielder off-balance after attacking. When making a Parry with an Unbalanced weapon, the Explorer's Weapon Skill is considered to be 10 points lower.\n\nUNRELIABLE\nWeapons with this quality are prone to jamming or misfiring. An Unreliable weapon jams on any dice roll of 91 or higher. When an Unreliable weapon is fired on Semi-Auto or Full-Auto Mode, each shot fired counts as two shots against the clip size by half (this only occurs the first time it is fired in a turn), and the weapon also jams on a dice roll of 96 or higher. Giving the weapon both the Reliable and the Unreliable special qualities cancels both effects.\n\nLAS WEAPONS\nLas weapons are amongst the most common and reliable weapons employed by the Imperium. While somewhat lacking in stopping power compared to solid shot weapons, they are reliable, easy to maintain, and have reasonable ammunition life. With a simple, sturdy design, a well-made lasgun can last for hundreds of years of regular service even outside the Imperium.\n\nLas weapons work by firing short, sharp pulses of laser energy from high-capacity power packs through a focusing array. The result is a distinctive ruby beam accompanied by a loud crack, like the tracking of high energy through air. Las weapons come in a multitude of different marks, makes, and patterns depending upon the place of manufacture. The standard Imperial Guard issue las weapons use charge packs which can be recharged by exposing the pack to heat or sunlight, though this diminishes the lifespan of the pack and increases the chance of malfunction. Las weapons in the hands of those who can afford them often use higher quality power cells, placing them on par with the best weapons available to the masses.\n\nTo use las weapons requires Pistol Training (Las), Basic Weapon Training (Las), or Heavy Weapon Training (Las) talents.\n\nRECHARGING POWER PACKS\nLas power packs may be recharged in a number of ways. Generally, recharge stations are available. Las power packs can also be recharged by leaving them in the sun for an extended period, but this may cause the power cells to short out or otherwise malfunction. A Character that makes a successful Tech-Use Test may recharge a power pack by connecting it to an appropriate power source; the exact time it takes to perform this task depends on the nature of the source and is ultimately up to the GM, but typically takes 1d5 hours."

Ornately decorated and extremely accurate despite their small size, duelling pistols are one-of-a-kind antiques prized by collectors and the very wealthy.\n\nLASGUN\nProduced in countless different styles and marks, the lasgun is the mainstay weapon of the Imperial Guard and countless millions of loyal fighters and defenders of the Imperium. Numerous forge worlds and manufactoria produce their own marks and patterns of this simple yet effective weapon. Lasguns are prized for their reliability and durability, serving as the standard service weapon for both the Emperor's faithful and many of their foes.\n\nHELLPISTOL & HELLGUN\n(LUCIUS-PATTERN)\nThe powerful, emitter-focused hellgun and smaller hellpistol are exclusive to high-ranking officers and elite corps. The higher power output requires their connection to a backpack power generator through a thick cable; some patterns of heavy hellpistols incorporate smaller versions of this powered cell. Lucius-Pattern hellguns use a 10 kg backpack power supply for the standard rifle, with a smaller plug-in pack for the smaller hellpistols. Their increased energy output means greater power behind each shot, but the backpack requirement makes reloading impractical, which is why a hellgun takes 6 Full Actions to reload once depleted. Both weapons can be linked to a suitable power source (see page 135)."

      "text": "LASPISTOL\nLaspistols are the most common and widely carried sidearms in the Imperium. With a well-maintained weapon, an Explorer can survive extended periods in the wilderness with only his trusty laspistol and a spare power pack. Las weapons make a distinctive sound when fired, like the sound of snapping air followed by a loud crack. Laspistols come in many different shapes and styles, with some worn as wrist-mounted ornaments or built into staffs of office for Imperial functionaries.\n\nMAN PORTABLE LASCANNON\n(ARCHEOTECH)\nFew weapons can tear through even the thickest armour at range with the lethal potency of a man portable lascannon. The incredible range and power come at the cost of enormous weight, requiring a separate power pack many times the size of normal weapon power packs. Shoulder-mounted and tripod models are often preferred, particularly if they allow the weapon to be fired like a rifle. It is possible to fire one-handed (if the wielder is exceptionally strong), though that's not generally recommended. Such weapons are exceedingly rare in the Koronus Expanse, with only the wealthiest of Rogue Traders and collectors willing to sacrifice almost a full trooper's weight in gold for one. Such weapons require absolute respect.\n\nLASCARBINE (LOCKE-PATTERN)\nLighter than a standard lasgun, the Lascarbine has a much shorter barrel and a wider discharge beam. The folding stock allows the Lascarbine to be fired with one hand with only a -10 penalty (rather than the normal -20), though its limited range and power make it less desirable for military purposes.\n\nSOLID PROJECTILE WEAPONS\nPopularly known as slug-throwers, weapons that use solid kinetic projectiles remain common throughout the Imperium. Most civilized worlds task their PDF forces with maintaining general peace, and allow citizens to arm themselves with autoguns and other basic projectile weapons to defend their homes. So common are these weapons that many settlers on newly discovered planets often build their own workshops to produce ammunition, rather than waiting years for resupply from distant Imperial worlds. Solid projectile weapons require a Basic Weapon Training (SP) talent to use effectively."

      "text": "AUTOGUN\nCheap and easy to produce, autoguns are common throughout the Imperium. These automatic weapons fire solid low-calibre shells fed from standardised clips. Reliable, sturdy, and easy to maintain, they are often used with simple stubber ammunition. They cannot match the reliability of las weapons, but autoguns remain a resilient and reliable weapon found across the galaxy.\n\nAUTOPISTOL\nSelf-loading and effective, autopistols are compact versions of the autogun but with correspondingly decreased range and power. The light weight and rapid firing capability make them popular among military non-combatants who need a sidearm for self-defense in close quarters situations.\n\nHAND CANNON\nThese weapons kick with tremendous force and are easily capable of stopping a charging assailant with a well-placed shot. They are renowned for their stopping power, though often difficult to aim. The tremendous recoil can be a liability in poor hands, with shots easily going wide.\n\nHEAVY STUBBER\nEven the lowest-tech manufactoria can produce these basic weapons. They are more easily maintained and their simple mechanisms allow them to withstand damage better than more advanced weapons. Heavy stubbers create a curtain of suppressive fire to hold back groups of attackers. Their relatively short range and limited stopping power are offset by their volume of fire. Ship-board models are commonly used for void combat, as they have little risk of causing hull breaches when firing down corridors. Lighter hand-held or tripod-mounted versions are common on most Imperial worlds, used by local PDF forces and garrison troops alike.\n\nSHOTGUN\nShotguns are common across the Imperium, capable of firing a variety of ammunition types from simple metal pellets to more specialized loads. Their reliability, ease of maintenance, and devastating results at close range make them a favorite of warriors and enforcers throughout the galaxy. Multiple variants exist, with the pump-action model being among the most common. The intimidating sound of a shotgun's loading mechanism has ended many confrontations before they began.\n\nSHOTGUN PISTOL\nCombining the qualities and design of a pistol with the stopping power of a shotgun, these weapons feature an extremely short barrel configuration. Typically designed as single-shot or break-action weapons, shotgun pistols are popular with many naval ship's officers who need an intimidating, close-range weapon. The substantial recoil makes them difficult to handle for the less experienced, with a -10 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests when fired with one hand.\n\nSTUB AUTOMATIC\nA low-tech pistol firing metal ammunition through a lightweight, mechanized action. Like the autopistol, it is easy to produce and maintain but lacks stopping power against heavily armoured targets. These small, concealable weapons are commonly found across Imperial worlds and have been in production for millennia. Some ancient patterns are extremely valuable among collectors."

      "text": "STUB REVOLVER\nPerhaps the simplest and most reliable solid-slug weapon in existence, the stub revolver is still manufactured by individual gunsmiths across the galaxy. While slower to reload than most pistols, it is extremely reliable and operates well under adverse conditions. Its relatively straightforward mechanical action means fewer moving parts that could jam or malfunction.\n\nNAVAL SHOTCANNON\nThese weapons are essentially a much larger pattern of shotgun, designed to repel boarding parties and blast attackers at close range from defensive positions. They can literally rip apart unarmoured foes with their tremendous blasts of shrapnel. Typically mounted on swivel mounts in ship corridors and at critical access points, these weapons are standard issue aboard most Imperial Navy vessels.\n\nBOLT WEAPONS\nFew weapons command the respect and fear that bolt weapons do. Relics from a more advanced age, bolt weapons are often ornate and ancient heirlooms passed from generation to generation. While models designed for normal human use exist, they remain uncommon weapons outside the elite forces of the Imperium. The standard bolter round is expensive and difficult to manufacture, and only the elite of the Imperium have ready access to these sacred weapons.\n\nBolt weapons are gyro-stabilized, mass-reactive weapons that fire self-propelled explosive shells. Each uses a miniature solid fuel rocket housed within a metal core, detonating a mass-reactive charge within the target. Bolters require careful maintenance with ancient rituals to prevent jamming, a problem due to the high pressures involved. To use the various bolt weapons requires Pistol Training (Bolt), Basic Weapon Training (Bolt), or Heavy Weapon Training (Bolt) talents.\n\nBOLT PISTOL\n(CERES-PATTERN)\nBolt pistols are traditional sidearms for Space Marines and many senior naval officers. Though bulky for human hands, they remain superior weapons dishing out tremendous damage. The standard Ceres-pattern bolt pistol is common within the Imperial Navy, and perhaps fittingly, they are also most commonly found among Rogue Traders operating in the Koronus Expanse, although ancient patterns remain rare and highly sought after.\n\nBOLTGUN (LOCKE-PATTERN)\nThe common bolter weapon used by Space Marines and other elite warriors, bolters fire mass-reactive projectile ammunition. Ornate versions showing long service and countless battles are prized treasures. The Locke-pattern weapon is an old Adeptus Astartes design, and the most commonly seen pattern among Rogue Traders in the Koronus Expanse, although only manufactured in limited quantities.\n\nSTORM BOLTER (MARS-PATTERN)\nStorm Bolters arose from experiments combining two bolters into a single weapon to achieve greater firepower. These dual-wielded weapons are rare and often bear purity seals, sacred inscriptions, and holy glyphs that speak of their ancient origins. They are the most ornate of bolt weapons and highly prized for their military effectiveness.\n\nHEAVY BOLTER (SOLAR-PATTERN)\nHeavy bolters are devastating weapons used for anti-infantry suppression fire. They can hurl impressive streams of explosive shells, each using much larger shells with more propellant and greater lethality. Like all bolters, they require careful maintenance with ancient rituals to avoid jamming, a common problem due to the high pressures and forces involved."

      "text": "MELTA WEAPONS\nMelta weapons (also known as \"melters\") are devastating short-range thermal weapons which can melt through almost any material. Unlike las or solid projectile weapons, meltas use sub-molecular thermal energies directed down the barrel. Melta usage is accompanied by a distinctive roaring blast as the beam boils away anything in its path, reducing the target to charred slag. No vehicle armor can withstand their power. To use meltas requires Pistol Training (Melta), Basic Weapon Training (Melta), or Heavy Weapon Training (Melta) talents.\n\nINFERNO PISTOL\n(MARS-PATTERN)\nThe Inferno Pistol represents specialized ancient technology almost impossible to replicate. Even handfuls of these weapons are jealously guarded across the Imperium, coveted treasures for those fortunate enough to possess one. Their short range is offset by their immense thermal power, which makes them devastating for breaching bulkheads and burning through armor.\n\nMELTAGUN\n(MARS- AND MEZOA-PATTERN)\nMore reliable and causing fewer catastrophic failures than plasma guns, and working best at extremely short ranges and in boarding actions, meltaguns are often the weapon of choice for void-based combat. Both patterns use cylindrical fuel canisters. The Mars-Pattern has a long, thin barrel while the Mezoa forge world pattern has a heavier, more blocky design but is equally effective.\n\nMULTI-MELTA (MARS-PATTERN)\nSometimes called a \"mega-melta,\" the multi-melta is usually employed by Adeptus Astartes mounted upon an Imperial vehicle. This huge weapon uses far more fuel and fires a much wider beam than a standard meltagun, also generating much more heat. The weapon requires massive coolant tanks or it will quickly overheat after firing. Many Rogue Traders outfit their elite armsmen with these devastating weapons, particularly when facing unknown alien threats.\n\nTHERMAL LANCE (MARS-PATTERN)\nWith a much longer barrel with added directional venting for beam dispersal at the cost of lowered damage, this is a squad-support weapon intended for use by battlefleet armsmen. These weapons are popular with void-born warriors, where directed thermal lances can burn through bulkheads without risk to the surrounding ship structure. This weapon represents one of the few examples still in limited production within the Imperium, crafted by a handful of the inner circle of the Adeptus Mechanicus and their Tech-Adept assistants. Existing weapons are carefully maintained and handed down generation to generation, with each operator carefully ensuring proper rites of maintenance honor the Machine God before each use.\n\nPLASMA WEAPONS\nPlasma weapons harness the power of artificial suns, using hydrogen fuel suspended in a containment field to create miniature fusion reactions. Inside the weapon, hydrogen isotopes are heated to extreme temperatures and contained by powerful magnetic fields. When triggered, these fields collapse and the plasma is ejected in a devastating burst of energy. Plasma weapons can either be powered by replaceable fuel flasks or backpack containment vessels housing miniature fusion reactors. To use plasma weapons requires Pistol Training (Plasma), Basic Weapon Training (Plasma), or Heavy Weapon Training (Plasma) talents.\n\nFIRING PLASMA WEAPONS\nPlasma weapons can be fired in two modes - a standard mode, or an overcharged maximum power mode that not only increases damage but also increases range at the cost of added heat and risk. Weapons with the Overheat quality are more prone to catastrophic failures. Additionally, plasma weapons with the Recharge quality require additional time between shots to replenish their energy cells (the specific time will vary with each weapon's construction). Maximum mode (also called Battle Mode) always indicates the higher Damage and Pen values."

      "text": "PLASMA PISTOL (RYZA-PATTERN)\nThe deadliest pistol commonly available in the Imperium, the plasma pistol can unleash devastating blasts capable of tearing through almost any armor. Typically wielded by only the most senior officers who view them as status symbols, these weapons hold highly concentrated hydrogen fuel contained within small flasks, and thus can only fire a single shot before requiring recharging.\n\nPLASMA GUN (MEZOA-PATTERN)\nThe more powerful larger cousin to the plasma pistol, this weapon contains a larger fuel containment vessel, which enables executing more shots before recharging. Many Rogue Traders outfit their elite armsmen with these potent weapons, particularly their boarding teams.\n\nPLASMA CANNON (RYZA-PATTERN)\nThis most portable heavy plasma weapon includes a heavy backpack containing the magnetic accelerators and superheated magneto-spheres of hydrogen fuel. This weapon has a much longer ammunition supply and a more violent discharge, hurling massive balls of super-heated plasma that explode on impact, creating a hotter core capable of destroying even armored targets.\n\nFLAME WEAPONS\nFlame weapons are not only effective in burning the enemy but also serve a symbolic purpose, carrying the cleansing flames brought forth by the Imperial Creed and giving the most sacred pronouncement of the Imperium (the burning of heretics) physical form. Flame weapons use promethium fuel economically refined from crude oil, or similar industrial petrochemical concessions. When fired on the move, depending on their model, most pistol flame weapons are somewhat less effective than other weapons. To use flame weapons requires Pistol Training (Flame), Basic Weapon Training (Flame), or Heavy Weapon Training (Flame) talents."

      "text": "HAND FLAMER (MEZOA-PATTERN)\nGood for only close personal combat, the Hand Flamer has changed little through the ages, being designed either to be mounted under the small barrel of another sidearm, or to serve as a distinctive signature weapon across the galaxy. It makes an excellent anti-personnel weapon while producing enough heat to deter some technological denizens. The compact size makes it a popular choice among Imperial Guard officers on hive worlds.\n\nFLAMER (MEZOA-PATTERN)\nIdeal for flushing out enemies with purifying flame, the standard hand-held flamer is the armsman and pirate's favoured weapon. Modern versions copied from Mechanicus designs feature larger fuel tanks and simpler systems that allow for faster refuelling and a reduced chance of malfunction.\n\nHEAVY FLAMER (LOCKE-PATTERN \"HELLSENT\")\nHeavy flamers fire twice as much fuel in a directed jet of flames as the basic Flamer. A larger back-mounted fuel tank (which also helps ensure they are not prone to failure) provides the fuel, making the Hellsent popular when boarding enemy vessels. These weapons are devastating against unarmoured foes when fighting in the dense and confining corridors of void combat.\n\nPRIMITIVE WEAPONS\nEven in the 41st Millennium low-tech weapons can be found on newly discovered planets where either technology is minimal or society has collapsed back to a primitive level. Some feudal worlds maintain primitive weapons out of cultural preference, but reduce the weapon's range in metres against foes with quality armor. Primitive weapons can offer more concealability when modern sensors are employed, leading to an additional roll (see Page 126). To use primitive weapons requires Melee Weapon Training (Primitive) or, for primitive thrown weapons, the Thrown Weapon Training (Universal) talent."

      "text": "CROSSBOW\nCrossbows are among the higher tech primitive weapons, with a mechanical firing mechanism that draws a bowstring taut before releasing it at the pull of a trigger. Most crossbows have greater hitting power than the simpler hand bow but take longer to reload, generally requiring a winch or similar mechanism. Their precision aiming mechanisms make them easier to use than a bow, and many explorers and settlers are more familiar with them than more sophisticated ranged weaponry.\n\nFLINTLOCK PISTOL\nThese primitive black powder weapons take many forms, from freely crafted pistols constructed for the nobles of feudal worlds to heirloom pistols some centuries old from the underclasses of hive worlds. They are characteristically noisy and unreliable, making them weapons of last resort; these weapons use simple flash-ignited black powder and primitive mechanisms. Only the most low-tech worlds or desperate scenarios would see widespread flintlock use.\n\nLONGBOW\nThe longbow is equally deadly and requires great skill to use, a ritual among many of the feudal worlds of the Imperium. The longbow offers the hitting power of a crossbow but can be fired somewhat more quickly. Cultural traditions on some feudal worlds often involve bows as symbols of martial prowess.\n\nSLING\nSlings are easy to create and consist of a cord used to hurl a small object (rock, pellet, or metallic slug) at a target. When fired the sling generates Damage with the effect of a melee weapon in the hands of an Explorer; the exact weight of the projectile determines the actual Damage. With the right ammunition and sufficient skill, a sling can cause significant pain from additional wounding effects (see page 126).\n\nLAUNCHERS\nGRENADES AND MISSILES\nRogue Traders know the simple effectiveness of weapons with either thrown grenades or projectiles fired from a launcher. The former are easily concealed and the latter provide additional reach with minimal training. Neither needs an accompanying power source like most Imperial energy weapons. These include grenade launchers, missile launchers, and other munitions which often see use in boarding actions, as only armoured bulkheads provide real protection from the blast.\n\nGrenades and missiles each come in a variety of types, and the munitions in the tables represent the most common types of grenades and missiles available. Launcher weapons require either Basic Weapon Training (Launcher) or Heavy Weapon Training (Launcher) talents to use effectively."

    {
      "pageIndex": 129,
      "text": "GRENADE LAUNCHER\nThe grenade launcher is shorter range than other heavy weapons due to the projectile's simple explosion mechanism rather than motor-driven munitions. The weapon fires both grenades and modified grenades. The Forge World of Mezoa produces what many consider a superior shoulder-mounted version that has a more sophisticated firing system and is highly reliable.\n\nMISSILE LAUNCHER\nHeavy missile launchers fire a variety of projectile rocket-propelled explosives over long distances, aided with stabilisation and guidance systems. Missile launchers like the Avalus-pattern shoulder-mounted weapons can be wielded by a single individual, while the gargantuan Titan-mounted versions require huge crewfields and skilled operators. The missile launcher has become one of the Imperium's most familiar anti-vehicle weapons.\n\nTHROWING GRENADES\nThrowing grenades requires no special training beyond basic coordination. Characters roll a Ballistic Skill Test including any modifiers (such as range) to determine if the thrown grenade hits the desired target. Failing the Test indicates the grenade has gone off target; roll 1d10 to determine the direction of deviation and 1d5 to determine the distance in metres. As with launcher grenades, there are many kinds available.\n\nANTI-PLANT\nThese grenades release a range of toxic and viral agents that quickly reduce almost any type of flora to a foul-smelling necrotic muck that depresses vegetation growth while not seriously affecting most animal matter. Anti-plant grenades are primarily used to clear foliage and dense vegetation quickly.\n\nBLIND\nBlind grenades explode with a coruscating silver-white phosphex mixture that produces dark grey smoke including IR bafflers and broad-band EM scattering chalf, designed to place all sensory detection devices in considerable confusion. The effect lasts 2d10 Rounds.\n\nFRAG\nFragmentation grenades and missiles are simply high explosive shells designed to create high velocity shrapnel fragments when they detonate, deadly when thrown in enclosed spaces.\n\nEGERIAN GEODE\nThese grenades are filled with compressed fluids of diamantine heat-reactive crystalline material, causing a powerful explosion when they detonate.\n\nHALLUCINOGEN\nThese grenades induce nightmarish hallucinations and psychoactive confusion in targets. Those affected must succeed on a Difficult (-10) Toughness Test or become deluded and insensate. Roll 1d10 on Table 5-5: Hallucinogen Effects to determine the effects. Failing this Test means the character experiences vivid hallucinations for 1d10 minutes."

      "text": "KRAK\nKrak grenades release concentrated explosive force in point-blank detonations. They do less damage against personnel but are great against vehicles and other larger targets. Krak grenades produce powerful detonations but do not produce massive spray like frag grenades. This specialised penetration design makes them poor against infantry or other lightly-armoured targets.\n\nSMOKE\nUnlike the blind grenade, these release smoke which only obscures basic eyesight and standard visual detection systems that depend on normal human eyesight, but not more advanced scanners. Smoke grenades are much more widely available and easier to conceal.\n\nSTUN\nStun grenades use a combination of loud explosive sound and a brilliant flash of light to temporarily disorient targets before combat. They are designed for non-lethal uses and generally cause lasting injury only in rare cases. Anyone caught in the explosion becomes immediately disoriented; with the grenade blast causing them to make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. If they fail, they become Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. Photo-visors and similar equipment give a +20 bonus to this Test.\n\nVIRUS\nVirus grenades house powerful biological agents which break down biological systems moments before releasing airborne pathogens to infect them. They can kill scores of people before mutating into non-lethal final forms, running out of victims near enough to infect.\n\nXENO FILAMENT\nXeno filament grenades contain compressed monofilament wire made from microcrystalline materials - the equivalent of macroscopic razor wire that cuts through flesh and bone with deadly efficiency. Unfortunately, the advent of personal force fields (such as Refractor Fields and Conversion Fields) has made filament grenades less popular in recent years.\n\nPLASMA\nThese grenades contain a deliberate plasma containment failure, causing a vast cloud of deadly plasma in a destructive blast of heat and light upon detonation. They are especially deadly against armoured targets and vehicles.\n\nPHOTON FLASH\nPhoton flash grenades (simply flash grenades) detonate moments before releasing a blinding release of light, overwhelming most vision protection systems. Anyone caught without eye protection is blinded for 1d10 Rounds; they must succeed on a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test to reduce this effect to only temporary blinding, lasting a single Round.\n\nTABLE 5-5: HALLUCINOGEN EFFECTS\n1-10: \"My hands—I can't feel my hands!\" The character drops everything he's carrying in the hands and examines them intently for the duration.\n\n11-20: \"They're coming through the walls!\" The character believes enemies are coming through the walls around him and fires his weapon (if any) at random.\n\n21-30: \"Nobody can see me if I can't see them.\" The character wanders blindly about, bumping into people and objects. He suffers a -30 penalty to all Tests requiring vision.\n\n31-40: \"My blood is on fire!\" Roll a die. On an odd result, the character believes enemies are trying to douse the flames with blood and attacks the nearest foe. On an even result, the character becomes filled with burning rage (see Frenzy, page 98).\n\n41-50: \"I'm being eaten alive!\" The character claws desperately at his skin, dealing 1d5 points of Damage to himself per Round for the duration. He may make a Toughness Test to snap out of it.\n\n51-60: \"We're all going to die!\" The character is filled with dread. Use the Fear results on page 287.\n\n61-70: \"Others are in on the conspiracy!\" The character becomes utterly paranoid, attacking strangers who approach or mutter quietly nearby.\n\n71-80: \"The flesh is weak!\" The character is affected by Frenzy (see page 98), lashing out in a wild rage against the closest identified target.\n\n81-90: \"The Emperor's light!\" The character sees glowing halos around all targets randomly, determining \"friend\" or \"foe\" by the color perceived. He attacks allies, thinking they enemies.\n\n91-100: \"My universe is expanding!\" The character becomes so highly fixated that he collapses catatonic, staring blankly at his expanding mental cosmos."

Those caught in the gun's blast are flung to the floor with tremendous force, crushing them against the ground and pinning them down. Rumors swirl that these ancient weapons stem from Dark Age of Technology and each one is a jealously guarded device locked away by the Adeptus Mechanicus, who very rarely allow one outside their possession.\n\nEverything caught in the gun's blast must make a Very Hard (-30) Strength Test or be knocked down from a standing position and forced to the ground. This will cause 1d5 (Primitive) Damage against the Body location, although what the character or object is thrown against can make this effect far worse.\n\nAnyone affected remains within the blast radius for 2d5 Rounds, and afterward, an opposed Strength Test with a -30 penalty is required to stand up. Within normal operations the gun cannot be moved after firing or the field collapses instantly.\n\nAt the GM's discretion, the flux may also break loose flooring, rupture containment fields, malfunction electronics, or wreak havoc in other appropriate ways. Even a number of shots fired into the same area can create strange effects.\n\nNEEDLE PISTOLS\nNeedle pistols are low-powered, high-precision weapons firing crystalline slivers designed to penetrate flesh and bone with ease. When fired, the weapon makes virtually no sound beyond a soft hiss as the needle leaves the barrel. The weapon's precision targeting systems mean needles drill through vulnerable points with unnerving accuracy.\n\nEach round, needles are modified to carry specialized venoms, most typically delivering either a sleeping agent or one that causes extreme pain and terminally intense nervous responses. At the GM's discretion, other kinds of toxins could be used with the weapon."

      "text": "NEEDLE RIFLE\nA longer-barreled needle weapon combining a much more complete scope for targeting critical locations and a larger magazine. The exceptional range makes these weapons highly prized by snipers, assassins, and others who value stealth kills over pure force.\n\nORK SHOOTA\nA sturdy, primitive, but surprisingly resilient weapon, Ork 'shootas' are basically large machine guns with extended barrels. Despite their crude appearance, shootas can unleash significant damage behind them if an Ork manages to aim straight. While humans are physically able to use these weapons, their size and recoil mean they're best left to the greenskins.\n\nORK SLUGGA\nAn even more brutish version of the shoota, the slugga is basically a crude hand cannon that operates on similar principles. The undersized grip and heavy recoil make them difficult to aim accurately. During boarding actions, sluggas have been recaptured from the corpses of Ork invaders and used by desperate defenders when their own weapons run dry.\n\nCHAIN WEAPONS\nChain weapons are popular, ancient weapons that date back to the Dark Age of Technology. They come in a variety of styles, but all feature fast-moving metallic teeth on chains, guided through a rigid casing that focuses the teeth like an edged weapon.\n\nOnce engaged, the chain spins very rapidly (near instantly) and the sharp teeth can tear through normal flesh and solid blows can penetrate even armor. Chain weapons require the Melee Weapon Training (Chain) talent.\n\nCHAINSWORD\nChainswords feature a flattened casing containing the chain with only the forward curved section exposing the spinning chain teeth that can bite into flesh and bone. On one side, a reinforced point makes for excellent piercing strikes. Despite the gruesome deaths they can bring, the characteristic whine of a chainsword both intimidates enemies and serves to rally friendly forces.\n\nCHAINAXE\nChainaxes are deadly, packing the weight of an axe with the tearing bite of a chainsword behind each blow, but lacking defensive maneuvers. They can either be one or two-sided. Each open edge contains its own chain loop, meaning that if the double-sided version can still operate if one side is ruined.\n\nPOWER WEAPONS\nPower weapons project a disrupting energy field along the blade or head of a weapon, allowing it to better shear through armor and metal. They use special field mechanisms and embedded microcircuitry containing ancient lost technology.\n\nWithin the Imperium, a variety of marks and patterns for power weapons exist. The Mezoa-pattern features shorter handles but larger and choppier blades. Power weapons require the Power Weapon Training talent.\n\nPOWER MAUL\nPower mauls deliver devastating lightning strikes across a studded-metal discharge surface. A power maul is essentially a small shaft with a metal stud-wrapped power field at one end, and a hand grip at the other. Controls along the half allow the user to adjust the energy field's strength, allowing them to deliver anything from a stunning blow to a crushing force suitable for breaking down reinforced doors. They are popular with the Adeptus Arbites and many senior naval officers."

      "text": "POWER FIST (MEZOA-PATTERN)\nRather than creating an edged weapon power field, the power fist encases the energy within a huge glove which mechanically augments the fist strikes. Targets smashed by power fist impacts find their armor caved in and bodies crushed. Unlike worn power armor, the fist is a weapon requiring the proper talent to use effectively. The Mezoa-pattern design also includes crushing powerfields around the fingers, allowing the fist to pierce through even the strongest armor.\n\nOMNISSIAN AXE (SOLLEX-PATTERN)\nThe weapon's blade is shaped like half of the circular Adeptus Mechanicus skull-and-cog icon. Each ancient relic, which the machine priests consider sacred, is heavily inscribed with holy iconography indicating important Machine God memories. Two curved blade sections—each covered with inscribed circuits—form the weapon; the inside portion of the axe's blade includes detailed inscriptions honoring the Omnissiah and the cult.\n\nPOWER SWORD (MORDIAN-PATTERN)\nMore elegant than the other power weapons, swords rely on precision cuts and thrusts rather than brutal crushing force. The Mordian pattern is distinctive among the patterns found across the galaxy and beyond. The Mordian forge is lost—its location a carefully kept secret by a few—with the blades treasured for their thinner, two-sided blade. The Mordian-pattern's most distinctive trait is the humming sound released as the blade emits a crackling tone of energy while slicing through the air.\n\nEXOTIC MELEE WEAPONS\nRogue Traders often encounter the unusual and the strange in their exploits, and it is not surprising that they might acquire exotic weapons of unknown origin that many puritanical elements would consider both alien and heretical. These objects can be victorious trophies or useful tools—depending on who the beholder is. Some Imperial servants can justify such tools as being claimed for the Emperor's glory.\n\nFRACTAL BLADE\nThese specialized blades are formed from diamond-like living crystal designed to expand within flesh. Each blade is covered with a waxy coating to keep the edge dulled and blunt. When struck into flesh, flakes of the coating break off, and the blade emits a shrieking sound as the crystal expands—often violently—within the wound before retracting back into the scabbard for the next strike. Many victims are dead before knowing they were hit.\n\nHARLEQUIN'S KISS\nAmong the deadliest of all Eldar weapons, the harlequin's kiss resembles a long tube attached to the forearm of the wielder. The tube is filled with highly compressed monofilament wire sharpened on a molecular level. When the kiss is unleashed (via easily pierced barbs), the wire uncoils and lashes through even the smallest puncture, expanding inside the interior of a body or vehicle. In seconds, flesh is turned into liquid as the wire races through the victim and then retracts back into the device for the next kill.\n\nGHOST SWORD\nMany Explorers have long bladed items in their possession—some they find that are made from a seemingly translucent material that feels almost unreal to the touch. These exotic artifacts are ghostswords. Rumor holds they may have been taken from known alien cultures, but most believe ghost swords have much longer, darker histories. Often wielded by Eldar shadows operating along the webway or unknown paths into human-occupied worlds, the ghost sword tears through flesh and armor with deadly efficiency."

The Motion Predictor adds a +10 bonus to Ballistic Skill Tests when the weapon fires a single shot, and gives a +5 bonus when the weapon is firing on Semi-Automatic Mode.\n\nRED-DOT LASER SIGHT\nUpgrades: Pistol, basic-class (las, solid projectile, bolt, primitive, plasma) weapon\nThis projects a red-dot laser sight and targeting holo on the weapon's target. A weapon may only have one sight.\n\nSILENCER\nSilencers lower the noise from a weapon's discharge, making it more useful for stealth kills. A silenced weapon suffers an additional -10 penalty and reduces its effective range by half the normal distance.\nUpgrades: Stub revolvers, stub automatics, autopistols\n\nOMNI-SCOPE\nUpgrades: Basic-class (las, solid projectile, bolt, primitive, plasma) weapons\nThe Omni-scope combines the benefits of a Preysense Sight, Red-Dot Laser Sight, and Telescopic Sight into one device. The scope contains finely-tuned pict-lenses linked to precision cogitators, allowing the user to see around corners using a scope that would normally require a bionic cranial port. A weapon may only have one sight.\n\nSUSPENSORs\nUpgrades: Heavy weapons\nAnti-gravity suspensor coils mounted onto weapons significantly reduce their weight. Often the Adeptus Mechanicus tears these components from broken devices to help troopers field their heavy weapons. Suspensors reduce the weight of a weapon to one-half when firing. A weapon with suspensors counts as Overcharge Pack for the purposes of auto-stabilize; it cannot be combined with an Overcharge Pack.\n\nOVERCHARGE PACK\nEnhanced power pack for a las weapon. These packs increase both the weapon's Auto-Stabilize (for use with firing on semi-automatic or full-automatic) and a Half Action recharge field for the weapon or clip after firing. Unfortunately, the increased output from the Overcharge Pack means the weapon uses double the ammunition from the clip.\nUpgrades: Pistol (Las), Basic Weapon (Las)\n\nTELESCOPIC SIGHT\nA telescopic sight makes aiming easier, especially useful for long-range shots that need to be precisely placed. The telescopic sight ignores penalties for long and extreme range when firing single shots. A weapon may only have one sight.\n\nPHOTO SIGHT\nA sight that enhances ambient light, useful for operating in the dark. Characters using a Photo Sight count as having the Dark Sight trait. A weapon may only have one sight.\nUpgrades: Solid Projectile, Bolt, Primitive, Pistol weapons\n\nVOX-OPERATED\nA specially coded receiver is integrated into the weapon's trigger mechanism so that the user can operate the weapon by voice command alone. The user can use a selector to change frames/clips or to switch firing modes where applicable merely by speaking the appropriate command. Additionally, if the weapon is tied into a kill-switch or other command systems, the Explorer can fire the weapon simply by speaking aloud.\nUpgrades: Any Primitive, Pistol, Basic weapon"

Presented here are only a few of the types that might exist throughout the galaxy; the cost is for a weapon's full clip worth only, as tracking each and every round of ammunition would be onerous and time consuming. However, the GM may rule that availability varies based on location or other concerns.\n\nTABLE 5-11: UNUSUAL AMMUNITION\nName | Weight | Availability\n-----|--------|-------------\nAmputator Shells | 0.5 | Rare\nArrows/Quarrels | 0.25 | Common\nBleeder Rounds | 0.5 | Scarce\nBolt Shells | 0.5 | Rare\nDumdum Bullets | 0.5 | Average\nExpander Rounds | 0.5 | Scarce\nExplosive Arrows & Quarrels | 0.5 | Scarce\nHot-Shot Charge Pack | 1 | Rare\nMan-Stopper Bullets | 0.5 | Average\nTempest Bolt Shells | 0.5 | Very Rare\n\nARROWS/QUARRELS\nArrows or quarrels vary in manufacturing from crude wooden shafts with filing tips to polished steel darts with razor-sharp points.\nUsed With: Bows and crossbows and similar weapons.\n\nSHOT\nThese solid lead or stone balls are still used with massive blackpowder weapons.\nUsed With: Flintlock pistols and similar primitive weapons.\n\nBULLETS\nOne of the most common forms of ammunition within the Imperium; these metal projectiles are carried by countless billions of soldiers either in solid form or another unless they have access to a more sophisticated or esoteric weapon.\nUsed With: Autopistol, stub revolver, stub automatic, hand cannon, autogun, shotgun, and similar weapons.\n\nBACKPACK AMMO PACK/POWER PACK\nLarger portable power supplies used for charging and running multiple weapons requiring extended supply packages.\nUsed With: Heavy las weapons, hellguns and other weapons with backpack power supplies.\nEffects: This power pack uses the power pack rules, except the weapon's full clip value counts as fuel, allowing the weapon to fire without need for reloading. Backpack ammo packs weigh 2.5 kg.\n\nCHARGE PACK\nCharge packs are used almost exclusively by las weapons. Each pack provides a dense energy charge unit that delivers the las weapon's full clip value.\nUsed With: Laspistols, lasgun, long-las and similar weapons.\n\nFUEL\nA variety of liquid fuels with varying composition; quality varies from pure promethium to crude oils, flammable alcohols, and more exotic chemicals. Fuel provides enough for the weapon's full clip.\nUsed With: Hand flamers, flamers, heavy flamers.\n\nBOLT SHELLS\nThe standard bolt shell is a caseless, self-propelled explosive round consisting of a solid-fuel rocket propellant base and mass-reactive explosive tip, detonating on impact for maximum wounding effect. However, the difficulty of manufacture restricts their usage to essential cadres and elite naval forces, and rare outsiders such as Rogue Traders and others.\nUsed With: Bolt pistols, boltguns, and similar weapons.\n\nMELTA CANISTER\nStandard canisters containing low-yield fuel for melta weapons. A melta canister provides enough for the weapon's full clip value.\nUsed With: Inferno pistols, meltaguns, multi-meltas.\n\nPLASMA FLASK\nWeapon fuel containing highly dangerous, condensed and contained mini-suns from the harsh fields of hydrogen and helium isotopes. A plasma flask provides enough for the weapon's full clip value. Damage and Penetration may vary based on how the plasma flask is utilized.\nUsed With: Plasma pistols, plasma guns, and plasma cannons."

Below is a detailed description of each type. Ammunition weight is not listed; each unusual ammo type counts as 10% of the weight of a weapon's full clip value.\n\nAMPUTATOR SHELLS\nUsed With: Laspistols, lasguns, long-las\nFilled with a concentrated micro-charge blast designed to shear flesh apart, tearing limb from torso with terrible effects. Amputator Shells add +1 to Damage.\n\nBLEEDER ROUNDS\nUsed With: Stub revolvers, stub automatics, autopistols, and autoguns\nThis ammunition contains chemicals which inhibit coagulation. These shells are designed to vent anti-coagulants quickly, spreading the anti-coagulants quickly.\nEffect: Bleeder rounds cause 1 point of additional Damage against biological targets (targets with the Daemonic or Machine trait suffer no additional damage).\n\nDUMDUM BULLETS\nThese hunting bullets are designed to expand and deform in a soft target, though they are less effective against armoured foes. Armor Points count double against them.\nUsed With: Stub revolvers, stub automatics, autopistols, and autoguns.\n\nEXPANDER ROUNDS\nThese specialized shells are designed to expand upon impact, creating maximum tissue damage with minimum penetration. The weapon's Damage and Penetration decrease (-1 Damage and -1 Penetration).\nUsed With: Stub revolvers, stub automatics, autopistols, and autoguns.\n\nEXPLOSIVE ARROWS AND QUARRELS\nThese kinds of ammunition might be crudely improvised with small amounts of explosive material, from the noxious pilot-webs of needle weapons to the finely crafted tips of a needle pistol.\nEffects: Attacks are made with a -20 penalty; the weapon's damage type becomes Explosive and the weapon loses the Reliable quality.\nUsed With: Bows, crossbows, and bows.\n\nHOT-SHOT CHARGE PACK\nA much more powerful version of the standard las weapon power pack. These hot-shot charges grant the Tearing quality (roll two dice for its Damage and pick the highest), lose the Reliable special quality, and the clip is reduced to half of the weapon's full clip value.\nUsed With: Laspistols, lasguns, and long-las.\n\nINFERNO SHELLS\nEffects: Inferno shells catch targets on fire in addition to standard damage. The target must pass an Agility Test or burn for another 1d10 rounds, taking damage each round.\nUsed With: Stub revolvers, stub automatics, autopistols, shotguns, and autoguns.\n\nMAN-STOPPER BULLETS\nThese are custom developed, high-quality rounds designed to punch through armor and pierce flesh. Man-Stopper bullets increase Damage by +1 and Penetration by +2.\nUsed With: Stub revolvers, stub automatics, autopistols, and autoguns.\n\nTEMPEST BOLT SHELLS\nTempest bolt shells are among the deadliest main armament rounds in the Imperial arsenal. Tempest bolt shells are typically manufactured only for use in portable heavy bolters and stormbolters. The rounds contain powerful insulated plasma-core charges in combination with an electromagnetokinetic field generator; once this shell detonates, it is particularly effective against targets with internal electronics or complex systems.\nEffect: Change the weapon's damage to Energy. The weapon gains the Shock quality. The weapon adds +2 to Damage when used with the Mighty Shot talent.\nUsed With: Bolt pistols, bolters, and heavy bolters."

      "text": "ARMOUR\nAn ancient Imperial Guard saying used widely throughout the 41st Millennium is, \"Only a fool knows no fear when death surrounds him.\" While ceramite plate, meshweave fiber armor, carapace shields, and other pieces serve as essential options for those explorers in the reach of the Koronus Expanse, such options are but a small piece of the daily routine when working the far reaches of the Imperium. Though full body protection is rare in many places across the cosmos, armour points are measured by location to provide characterbuilds with technical expertise to choose their destination.\n\nLocations Covered: Workmanship Tours cover a character's Arms, Body, and Legs. The head is noted as Covering Full if a helmet is part of the suit.\n\nFor information on how much armour a character can wear, see Chapter IX: Playing the Game.\n\nARMOUR CRAFTSMANSHIP\nPoor: Badly fitted, designed for someone dramatically different in size, or made using inferior materials. Characters wearing Poor Armour take a -10 penalty to all Agility Tests while wearing the armor. Poor armour weighs twice the normal amount.\n\nCommon: Well-constructed, properly fitting armour of average craftsmanship. No bonuses or penalties.\n\nGood: Fine manufacture and quality fitting armour. Good Armour weighs half the normal amount and increases the AP by +1.\n\nBest: Finely wrought and perfectly fitted. Best armour is the epitome of what armour should be. It weighs half the normal amount and increases the AP by +2.\n\nMIXING ARMOUR\nCharacters may mix pieces of armour. However, special qualities do not overlap. When calculating armour, the highest AP value is used in each location. For example, a character wearing heavy leathers and mesh greaves from elbow to bicep on both arms gets the Armour Points of the mesh (AP 4) for the Arms hit location. Players cannot mix Poor quality armour with Good or Best craftsmanship."

      "text": "TABLE 5-12: ARMOUR\n\nPRIMITIVE ARMOUR\nPrimitive armour is common across the Imperium, especially on low-tech worlds where technology levels are minimal. Many armours appearing throughout the Imperium are essentially primitive in nature, constructed from hard materials rather than advanced technologies. The ability to reduce a weapon's penetration (Armour Points) is significantly reduced for weapons with the Primitive quality. Primitive armour provides half its normal protection (rounding down) against damage dealt by weapons that lack the Primitive quality.\n\nExamples: Heavy furs, hide armour, flak jackets, reinforced leathers\n\nFLAK ARMOUR\nStandard issue to the countless millions of Imperial Guardsmen across the galaxy, flak armour is designed to defeat solid shot projectiles and low-level energy attacks. Such easy-to-use armour makes each suit equally usable with little required training. Though commonly constructed out of solid bits from high-impact ceramics, it is relatively dependable yet usable. Most often comes as flak vest, flak coat, flak jacket, or flak coveralls.\n\nMESH ARMOUR\nThis high-tech armour is formed from bonded electroplas cells linked together in a fabric-like weave. Lightweight and comfortable to wear, the mesh reacts to incoming energy by becoming briefly rigid and dissipating the force through the material.\n\nARMOURED BODYGLOVE\nArmoured bodygloves combine various mesh-weave materials to provide protection with little reduction in mobility. Essentially a skintight bodysuit, normally tailored to the wearer and designed for comfort beneath normal clothing, the materials used range from simple mesh underlay providing basic protection to the finest carapace grade.\n\nCARAPACE ARMOUR\nGenerally worn by officers and elites across the Imperium, carapace armour is made from moulded ceramite or other strong materials. Rogue Trader carapace armour often includes helmet, while many Explorator-issue carapace suits are designed for simple operations with little protection. Damaged plates must typically be replaced without requiring purchase of a new suit.\n\nADVANCED HELMET SYSTEMS\nAdvanced helmets provide sensory capabilities linked into them beyond basic tactical protection. Common features include auto-senses, photo-visors, rebreathers, audio systems, and the ability to analyze outside the spectrum of normal sight and sound. Most helmets at the least include comm-links and microphones. Filters often linked to rebreather systems provide protection from chemical or toxin-rich battlefield environments."

      "text": "POWER ARMOUR\nPerhaps the most iconic symbol of the Imperium, power armour is worn by heroes carrying the Emperor's service. It takes many forms but is usually thick and very protective plates encasing power-assisted fibre bundles designed by the Emperor to strengthen mankind and employed over the millennia in a religiously maintained duty. Power armour provides excellent protection of a nature all but worn out in millennia after their essential manufacture. Traditionally, only a handful of individuals beyond the Adeptus Astartes, Adeptus Sororitas, and senior commanders of the Imperial Guard and Imperial Navy ever have the opportunity to wear it. Fully sealed with internal oxygen supply, power armour is constructed of thick and very protective plates. The mechanisms within greatly enhance the wearer's Strength from the fibre bundles, enabling what would otherwise become impossibly bulking armour to move with greater ease. The suit, which connects via neural plugs in the spine and neck, also provides heightened combat senses and filtering systems, navigational aid and other functions.\n\nCLOTHING\n\nBACKPACK\nSymbolic of the Imperium, the carrying service can take many forms but is usually a backpack-like item designed by the Emperor to strengthen mankind's exploration and survival. Kind of 'bag with attached straps' used widely carrying odds and ends. Comes in many forms ranging from the humble pack to more advanced mnemonic recall systems.\n\nCAMELEOLINE CLOAK\nThese active stealth-camouflage cloaks are made up of mimetic fibre that reads the colouration of the wearer's surroundings and attempts to blend the cloak to match it. When the hood is completely folded, the user can disappear into the dark. Characters with cameleoline cloaks gain a +20 bonus to Concealment Skill Tests when the cloak is properly worn.\n\nCHARM\nSmall items worn around the neck, wrist, or belt, charms typically represent luck, faith, blessing, or unity. The wearer believes they will protect them from malign influences. Charms take many forms including finger bones, fragments of blessed bolter casings, water from holy rivers, or even coinage woven into clothing. Such tokens are most common among the lower classes and penitent orders. Devotees of the Imperial Cult see charm values (particularly those of blessed origin) reduced momentarily when witnessing the unfolding plot calls for something bad to happen to them. If all the characters carry charms (as all Emperor-fearing souls should), then the GM can reduce the charm's Strength bonus.\n\nCHRONO\nCommon chronometers and time-keeping devices, dependent on location, are built in a wide variety of forms from simple wrist-worn timepieces to elaborate clockwork affairs and significant display ornamentation."

      "text": "NIGHT CLOAK\nNormally fashioned of long, fibrous materials and, more rarely, specialized synthetic fabric, the night cloak (with complete hood) will absorb light and emit almost none. When the hood is completely folded, the user can disappear into the dark. Characters with night cloaks gain a +10 bonus on Concealment Skill Tests when hiding in the dark. Gets very hot inside the cloak (Challenging (+0) Toughness Test per hour or suffer 1 point of Fatigue).\n\nPREYSENSE GOGGLES\nA relatively simple device, preysense goggles allow the user to perceive thermal imaging and heat signatures. Characters wearing preysense goggles gain a +10 bonus on Perception Tests based on vision and the Dark Sight trait.\n\nPHOTO-VISORS/PHOTO-CONTACTS\nAdvanced optics enhance low-level available light even on the darkest nights. Users can \"see\" in the dark and also gain the Dark Sight trait. Good craftsmanship visors can also dampen the effects of photon flash grenades, making the user immune to their disorienting effects.\n\nCLIP HARNESS/DROP HARNESS\nA compact, torso-worn safety line for void-operations or climbing, characters using a clip harness gain a +10 bonus to Climb Tests and cannot fall if properly harnessed. Clip harnesses are common for anyone moving about in zero gravity and other functions.\n\nREBREATHER\nConsisting of a simple mask over nose and mouth (or complete helmet), rebreathers contain their own air supply, allowing the wearer to breathe in hostile or toxic atmospheres. A character wearing a rebreather can breathe underwater or in toxic environments. However, rebreathers typically have an air canister that must be replaced; replacing a canister is a Full Action.\n\nCLOTHING AND ADORNMENT\nClothing, jewelry, and other forms of adornment can serve to illustrate the role or importance of an individual. Explorers' dress might note their Dynasty or faction, or otherwise indicate their place within the hierarchy. What a person wears can often reveal much about their background, homeworld, and calling.\n\nRECOIL GLOVES\nSpecialized smart gloves with interlocking plates connected with memory circuits and rigid struts around the hand and wrist, thus preventing wrist injury from heavy recoil when firing automatic weapons. A character wearing recoil gloves can fire weapons (including those with the Recoil trait) one-handed without suffering the normal -20 penalty to hit (suffers only -10 penalty instead). However, recoil gloves eliminate the ability to perform fine manipulation tasks.\n\nRESPIRATOR/GAS MASK\nThis breathing mask that covers mouth and nose, or entire face, and offers much better protection than filtration plugs. A character wearing a respirator gains a +20 bonus to Toughness Tests made to resist the effects of gas weapons and similar contaminants.\n\nFILTRATION PLUGS\nSimple plugs inserted into the nostrils, filtration plugs filter out breathable toxins and harmful gases. A character wearing filtration plugs gains a +10 bonus to Toughness Tests made to resist the effects of gas weapons and similar contaminants."

      "text": "SHIFTING FABRIC\nRare and highly lethal to produce, this exotic material remains scarce despite being highly popular on the Drusus Marches and Scintilla. The fabric, alternating light and dark patterns and rarely imported from distant regions throughout the Koronus Expanse and beyond, can alter its colours when infused with photo-reactive cells. Under smart systems when woven into fabric, it can even alter pigmentation colours every few seconds (when light or darkness triggers the sensor). Wearers of shifting fabric gain a +10 bonus to Concealment Skill Tests. Further, when wearing the appropriate pattern, the wearer receives one Armour Point for Body, Arms and Legs (this Armour does not stack with other armour). The suit encloses a full bodysuit, including Head. The main concern is that it is quite bulky and imposes a -10 penalty on Agility-based Tests.\n\nSURVIVAL SUIT\nWhen operating within harsh extreme conditions, survival suits are sophisticated environmental gear designed to protect from cold, heat, toxic gases, etc. Survival suits maintain proper body temperature, excellent infusion between body temperature and outside air (via heat exchange cells in the material), making these suits particularly useful for operations on hostile planets. Complete with hood and goggles, the suit effectively protects the wearer in varied and extreme environments with the climate control allowing them to operate in temperature extremes between -80° and +150° Celsius.\n\nSYNSKIN\nSynskin is a one-piece environmental bodyglove with a slick surface that molds to the wearer's form. Synskin adds one Armour Point to the location where it is worn (in addition to other worn armour) and the wearer gains a +10 bonus to Concealment and Silent Move Tests. In addition, the wearer becomes invisible to certain effects of the Dark Sight trait. Synskin does not stack with other armour bonuses of a similar nature or benefit, nor does it benefit from Craftsmanship modifiers.\n\nVOID SUIT\nThese sealed suits are intended to protect the wearer from hostile environment. Most void suits incorporate a rebreather and allow the wearer to survive in vacuum; simple void-suits that include tether harnesses are standard issue aboard most Imperial starships. The void suit provides adequate protection from the vacuum of the void (see A Treatise on the Void, page 218). A character wearing a void suit suffers no adverse effects in environments with little or no pressure or atmosphere.\n\nVOID SUIT (SELENITE-PATTERN)\nPerhaps the most common heavy void suit (derived from an ancient STC file), the Selenite suit includes a full helmet (covering face and the eyes), the suit is insulated with ceramic-fibre mesh for better heat and cold regulation and the bio-monitor systems include atmospheric selection switches. Superior suits come complete with waste- and hydro-management systems and can auto-seal hull breaches if depleted of oxygen.\n\nDRUGS AND CONSUMABLES\n\nAMASEC\nAmasec is a popular alcoholic drink distilled from wine. It varies from planet to planet with some being well-aged and others often little better than rough intoxicants. Good amasec from the finest families can reach truly astronomical prices.\n\nDE-TOX (DRUG)\nThis drug breaks the effects of most common toxins and poisons. Administered through a dermal patch or injected directly into the bloodstream, de-tox can cancel the negative and positive effects of poisons and drugs almost instantly. De-tox, however, brings with it some unpleasant side effects. After voiding the toxins, the character is stunned for 1d5 Rounds and takes a -10 penalty to all Tests for one hour."

      "text": "EXCESSIVE DRUG USE\nWhen used too often, especially many drugs, there is a chance for addiction. This represents an Explorer's body becoming dependent on more than one dose of a drug within a short time period. Make a Toughness Test for each use after the first within 24 hours; should you fail, the effect ends but further doses are needed within hours.\n\nLHO-STICKS\nLho-sticks are common with Imperial Guard troopers and many civilians. Each rolled and batting-filled tube contains a mildly narcotic (and somewhat calming) plant-derived substance which is inhaled through the tube. Lho-stick users can be identified by the smell of smoke clinging to their clothes.\n\nMEDKIT\nA typical medikit contains various cataplasm patches, contraceptics, and synthetic flesh applicators, along with everything a character with the Medicae skill needs for administering first aid. Characters with the Medicae skill get a +20 bonus when using a medikit.\n\nMEDKIT (ADVANCED)\nReserved for use by those with properly trained medical support, these kits can be used by almost anyone with the Medicae skill. Each contains a variety of items such as synthskin applicators, spray-on coagulants, diagnostic cogitator, built-in cognitors for diagnostic advice. This gives a +20 bonus to Medicae Tests when the character does not have the skill.\n\nRATION PACKS\nImperial processed, packaged, completely unrecognizable but edible food. The quality varies widely ranging from simple and poor (which can be bland dry wafers) to actual meals filled with nutritious strips of processed meat and synthesized flavors. Good for 72 hours of protein.\n\nRECAF\nRecaf is brewed from beans or leaves. The composition varies from planet to planet but most blends incorporate some form of stimms, including detoxified photomnemonic compounds.\n\nPROVENDER\nThe Imperium relies upon such delicacies unpossessable in more frontier regions, including exotic meats from agri-worlds and after-dinner delights. Many are sought after for their medicinal properties when applied appropriately (and may have hallucinogenic properties when applied inappropriately). Consumables fall solely for the purpose of demonstrating wealth and station (see Chapter IX: Playing the Game, Page 249).\n\nSACRED UNGUENTS\nThese small vials of holy water and sacred oils from Ophelia VII, Terra, and other sacred sites are blessed and consecrated by the Adeptus Ministorum. When applied, they immediately assist in warding off malign influences at a midpoint between faith and technological protection.\n\nOBSCURA (DRUG)\nProhibited across the Imperium due to its extremely addictive properties, this outlawed drug creates a dream-like state for 1d5 hours. Those under the effects of this hallucinogen remove any morale effects they might be experiencing, but they suffer a -30 penalty to all Perception Tests while under the effects of this drug. Once the effects wear off, they cannot take another drug for 4 hours.\n\nSLAUGHT (DRUG)\nAn illegal combat drug that heightens awareness and improves reflexes, making the user more deadly with ranged or melee weapons. After prolonged use, the user's skin hardens into a bark-like surface. While under the influence of slaught, a character increases his Agility Bonus and Perception Bonus by 2, but takes a -10 penalty to all Toughness, Willpower, and Agility Tests for 1d5 hours."

While under its effects, the user adds +2 to his Agility Bonus and Perception Bonus for 1d10 minutes. When the drug wears off, the character suffers a -10 penalty to all Toughness, Willpower, and Agility Tests for one hour.\n\nTHEOSOPHIST'S PHILTRE\nA thick, clear liquid forbidden by ancient law from the Dark Age of Technology, this draught deepens a character's mental faculties. Unfortunately, this likely miracle from the Dark Age of Technology comes with heavy warnings and extreme caution when consumed. The Theosophist's Philtre adds +5 to Intelligence for 1d5 hours. After it wears off, the character suffers a -10 penalty to all Strength, Toughness, and Agility Tests for one hour.\n\nTRANQ\nTranq covers a family of artificial alcoholic chemical blends made at a variety of locations across the Koronus Reach. The techniques for producing tranq have been carried from the Calixis Sector by crew-serfs, rumormongers, and wastrels. Though similar in end result, the effects of tranq temporarily numb the body and mind, producing a relaxed state of chemical euphoria and unusual thoughts. Common concoctions typically come in vials containing roughly a mouthful of liquid.\n\nTOOLS\n\nALMANAC ASTRAE DIVINITUS\nThis tech-device of the Divine Astroneficium is a favored tool of tech priests concerned with cataloguing nebulae, distant events in the void, their influences, celestial projections, lecture & paths. Though the device, unlike most tech-devices, is a bookish item stored between missions and appears ancient, containing numeric drift patterns nearby to re-insert into orbiting ship voids on a real-time basis. The standard use of an Almanac grants a +10 to Navigation and Pilot, Scholastic Lore (Astrology) Tests where radiation danger is directly relevant to the circumstances. With more than certain shielding, this device will be useless as signals cannot penetrate metal very well.\n\nSMALL ARMS COFFER\nA compact protective container with quick-release compartments designed to be slung on the back. These are useful for carrying weapons and protecting them from rust, damage from rough terrain, pilfering, and other hazardous conditions.\n\nAUTO QUILL\nThese scribing devices of ornate appearance allow anyone to write text in a remarkably clear, methodical script. A character with the Trade (Remembrancer) skill can use an auto quill to +10 bonus to related Tests."

      "text": "AUSPEX/SCANNER\nThis tool is used to detect energy emissions from biological entities or equipment. Using an auspex gives a +20 bonus to relevant Awareness Tests where appropriate. Common auspex systems include motion detectors and heat readers.\n\nCALCULANCE ARRAY\nGrid determination with fractal-matrix targeting, this calculator of the Mechanicus includes scrolling targeting data with hook-backs for ranged ballistic firing solutions that dramatically improve the user's aim. The calculance array grants a +10 bonus to Ballistic Skill Tests when firing single shots at targets beyond Short Range.\n\nCOMBI-TOOL\nCommon throughout the Imperium, everyone from hive-scribes to priests carry some kind of combi-tool. Such devices may be crude or primitive, but they combine several small, convenient tools that fold out from the device, such as a knife, pliers, several mechanical devices, and a small hammer. The combi-tool grants a +10 bonus to Tech-Use and Trade Tests when appropriate.\n\nGRAPPLEHAWK\nAerial device launching the sharp grappling hooks of mechanical predator birds precharged with suspension fields. Once launched into the air, a grapplehawk glides toward a target before swooping in mechanically, plunging talons or hooks into the target. Replete with enough suspensor fields for a grapplehawk to support weight enough for short distances, this equipment provides an excellent means for reaching parapets or scaling walls.\n\nDEMOLITION CHARGE\nA simple explosive device containing plastics for detonation, useful for destroying doors, breaching bulkheads, or damaging infrastructure. The listed weight for demolition charges assumes a reasonable explosive charge, though anything caught within the blast radius takes 3d10 Explosive Damage. For setting and defusing explosives, see the Demolition Skill on Page 98.\n\nDIAGNOSTOR\nA diagnostor is constructed for medical use for diagnosing problems. This handheld device includes a small data-engine and geometric display that analyzes patient information. Though it does not include every ailment known to the Imperium, and cannot replicate Tech-Use tests or advanced medical procedures, the diagnstor often helps field medics who are far away from proper medical care, granting +20 to Medicae Tests to diagnose ailments.\n\nGLOW-GLOBE/LAMP PACK\nCommon means of creating light at night or in darkened areas. A typical glow-globe or lamp pack lasts 1d5 hours, casting light in a 12-metre radius. The light can be shuttered down to create a more focused beam, projecting light 24 metres in a straight line but only illuminating a 2-metre wide path.\n\nGRAPNEL\nLightweight mechanical grapnel, often combined with a launcher with a thin but strong line or wire. While the grapnel allows the user to climb a tree, building, or other vertical surface, the mechanical grappler can be used to fire a hook that trails a line behind it, allowing the firer to climb to the destination point.\n\nGRAV-CHUTE\nA smaller version of a jump pack, these rely on suspensor fields to counter gravity. Worn above the shoulders with an activation switch, grav-chutes deploy a counter-gravity field that allows the wearer to safely return from a height. Unlike a jump pack, grav-chutes only slow descent rather than allowing the wearer to propel himself into the air."

      "text": "MAGNOCULARS\nThese powerful vision aids enhance the user's sight range. More advanced, high-quality magnoculars can also duplicate the effects of preysense or photo-visor by analyzing thermal readings or ambient light. Magnoculars add a +10 bonus to Perception Tests for the purposes of spotting distant objects.\n\nMANACLES\nHeavy, solid manacles often used by bounty hunters and enforcers to bind hands and restrain individuals. Also called \"shackles.\"\n\nMEMORANDUM & ORTHODOXY\nA massive twice-revised collection of speeches and castigations first assembled by Pontifarch Yorl in the 7th century M41. These are \"the Acts and Sermons of the Calixian Ministorum,\" and the work of Venerable Castigator-Missionary von Haussen among others. It is holy and well-known scriptural material, a ten-volume set meant primarily for teaching the Emperor's religious glory (approximately 230 written volumes).\n\nLORD-CAPTAIN'S BATON\nMany senior officers in the Imperial Navy carry these short golden rods affixed to their attire with fine chains. Most are highly engraved and ornamental, depicting the heraldry of their ship and position within the fleet. Being heavily inlaid with gold and generally costing the equivalent of a mid-level officer's yearly salary, these batons are a symbol of status as much as function. Typically fitted with embedded specialized micro-cogitators, a baton of the Rogue Trader contains integrations with the bridge machine spirits, continuously linked with the main helm station through accepted rituals. When the baton completes an arc proper from one location to another, the machine spirits of the ship recognize proper orders have taken place.\n\nMELTA BOMB\nMelta-charges designed to quickly adhere to metal surfaces. They contain a powerful shaped charge created specifically for assault actions. Melta bombs can cut through almost anything, being ideal for destroying bulkheads, vehicle hulls, etc. When a melta bomb explodes, it inflicts 3d10+10 Energy Damage with a Penetration of 12. Anything surviving the blast must pass an Agility Test or catch on fire, taking 1d10 Energy Damage with a Penetration of 4 each Round until extinguished.\n\nMICRO-BEAD\nThe micro-bead is a short-range intercommunication device worn in the ear, connecting to a miniature vocalizer worn near the throat. The device broadcasts a signal to other micro-beads within about one kilometer (though this range can be reduced by dense walls or other sources of interference).\n\nMAGBOOTS\nHeavy and bulky, these footwear contain electromagnetic soles that can lock to metal floors to aid movement in zero gravity. Standard issue for most honest Imperial citizens for traverse during void travel, they are widely sought after by armsmen and crew personnel during void-emergencies.\n\nMULTIKEY\nDesigned to open Imperial locks, a multikey has other uses. As the standard item for most honest Imperial citizens, the multikey is a simple, broadly useful item with several well-designed teeth for picking locks and door mechanisms. Such tools—always illicit, of course—are highly sought after by sinister individuals looking to pilfer and engage in unintentional lock-opening.\n\nMULTICOMPASS\nWhen exploring worlds, one of the most essential tech-items is the multicompass. Depending on the world and its field influence, the dangers by happenstance might appear especially few as the multicompass proves a worthy tool for analyzing magnetic variance and magnetic north, topographical variances, gravitational compass bearing, update altitude and such. Even the Mechanicus Calixis do not fully understand all the ancients crafts and hallowed devices possessing such capabilities.\n\nNAVIS PRIMA\nThese ancient astrolabes of the Divine Astronemicon outline safe routes through the warp from ancient works created from the Golden Age of Technology. Very few can read their secrets, as their surfaces are elaborately wrought with heraldry and strange map-like cartouches describing the twists and turns of the immaterium. Most have been draped in oddly colored materials with craftsmanship far exceeding that of the common laborer. The Navis Prima is reportedly unspeakable for the uninitiated, though using such an object requires forbidden arts and specialized knowledge. Many who have spent their lives studying the Navis Prima eventually go blind—whether this is a deficiency or normal is unknown, but for their disturbing whited-out eyes in some cases, Navis Prima users look entirely normal."

      "text": "PICT RECORDER\nPict recorders are small pict-eye devices, relatively simple image-recording devices with a lens for recording and playing back as well as recording ability. Each can be built into a vox-caster or comm-slate for later Imperial technical data quests. Used widely in interrogations and other nefarious events.\n\nPSY-FOCUS\nPsykers often carry a device to help them focus their power. While other people see but mere trinkets or rings, a psy-focus helps the psyker amplify and effectively channel their dominant psychic talent. When a psyker uses a Psy-focus, he may re-roll a failed Psyniscience Skill Test (see Chapter II: Skills, Page 98).\n\nREMUNERATION ENGINE\nOften brokers the views of Prospex and other wealthy minor houses of the Imperium, remunerator engines rapidly calculate the complex tide-flow of payment based on algorithmically enquired divinations. A Remunerator Engine adds a +10 bonus to Commerce and Evaluate Tests (see Chapter VII: Playing the Game, Page 274 for details). However, operating a Remunerator Engine requires the constant attention of the character (or servitor), requiring a Half Action for use.\n\nSERVO-SKULL\nServo-skulls are automated servitors mounted on anti-grav suspensors created from the sanctified skulls of those that loyally served the God-Emperor. Their cranial cavities have been retrofitted with small logic engines, and they are often maintained to include spiritual insight or technological analysis. These devices follow a master through gestalt programming linked to a specific person and obey his dictates; sometimes the skulls hover near to their owner and may perform simple functions such as carrying small items, providing light, or working as a vox. A character with the appropriate Tech-Use skill or other approved status may have one servo-skull allocated to him.\n\nSCREAMER\nScreamers are proximity alarms that detect motion or sound, depending on their design, and emit a klaxon alert when triggered. After three seconds of activated alert, the GM rolls for detection with a Perception of 75 for the purposes of detecting sounds or motions within 100 metres. Sophisticated versions with Good Craftsmanship add a +10 bonus to the screamer's Awareness Tests.\n\nSHIPBOARD EMERGENCY KIT\nComes with own dexks and thought, like decks dark can be used. The safety kit has a hololithic map showing safe routes from khalomet of where. Standard shipboard emergency kit (safety kit) weighs roughly 20kg and includes:\n• Glowstick: Good for 1d5 hours of steady illumination\n• Universal Power Cell: Powers a glow stick or filtration mask\n• Filtration-mask: Contains roughly 30 minutes, usually enough to get through toxic air if necessary\n• Anti-radiation tablets: Essential when exposed to plasma engine radiation or other spike-related matter\n• Spray-gel: This foul-smelling gel can seal and allow the field-fix to hold (each mix can cover 20 small (10 sq cm) punctures)\n\nSTUMMER\nThe reverse of a screamer, a stummer generates sounds that counter and cancel out other noise. When activated, all within 20 metres of the stummer find it effectively impossible to hear anything else. The stummer can run for 2d10 minutes before needing power renewal.\n\nVENOM RING\nA dangerous looking ring contains a deadly poison. One with the ring (or Good Craftsmanship) turns the right mechanism of the finger bearing it to introduce the substance into a drink. The venom ring deals 1d10 Toxic Damage, requires a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or the target suffers an additional 1d10 Damage per Round for 1d5 Rounds.\n\nVOX-CASTER\nA vox-caster is a simple communication device that can be used to send signals over great distances, including to a ship in orbit from a planet's surface. Using a vox-caster requires access to reception towers networked throughout an area; these casters require regular maintenance and ritual propitiation from operators, the Tech-Adept, and servitors."

      "text": "CYBERNETICS\n\nOver millennia, mankind has found a wealth of techniques for replacing body parts lost to misfortune or violence with artificial substitutes. From the elegant and subtle mechanisms of augmetic limbs incorporating psycho-conductive circuitry to the crude but functional devices favored among many lower classes within the Imperium, to high-class bionics designed to equal or exceed baseline human performance across a range of tasks, augmentation is common in the 41st Millennium. To the Adeptus Mechanicus, such refinements are synonymous with the Machine God's grace, extending life, augmenting abilities and powering the flesh with the purity of metal perfection. Others among mankind view cybernetics with a degree of suspicion, though in many parts of the galaxy limited implants have become common enough among the high nobility that they bear no real stigma. Others, of course, upon seeing major augmentation may react with fear, distrust, or even violence.\n\nWhat follows are the more widely available bionic and implant systems. Note that certain advanced or esoteric types of body augmetics are much rarer (and sometimes heretical in nature), and characters who possess numerous bionic implants usually have higher authority within the Imperium's social hierarchy. Modifiying believers with cybernetics are usually reserved for those deemed worthy, particularly those stationed in important positions within the Imperium, those among the Adeptus Mechanicus, or other special cases.\n\nATTACHING BIONICS AND IMPLANTS\nImplants are only available if the character has both the resources and skilled help to get them installed, commonly this is only available in colonies with medical facilities and worlds with a very high technological base or near a forge world. This process takes no less than 2d10 days to complete and requires daily Toughness Tests to avoid developing minor infections from implantation or more serious complications.\n\nGiven enough time, and a decent surgeon, the doctor can make Medicae or Tech-Use Tests that could lead to success. While listed in Chapter IX: Playing the Game, players make the choice to spend the money and time on these after gaining approval from the GM, the result of which might count as an additional burden to carrying items and penalties to Weapon Skill Tests made by all characters for a Round. This is a Half Action unless the character has the Tech Priest that serfs to Mars, and has the full simple machine designed around Tool (which deals 1d10 Damage, counts as a weapon with the Defensive quality, and has the Mono upgrade. The character must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to operate this implant.\n\nBIONICS AND CRAFTSMANSHIP\nThe Craftsmanship or quality of bionics should be considered in two major ways. First, cybernetic craftsmanship reflects not only the interior workings that make the mechanics function but also the aesthetic value as seen by others. Poor Craftsmanship bionics may be unreliable or unresponsive, while Good Craftsmanship may be smooth and operate with perfect response time. Common bionics may perform the necessary tasks but they visually make the recipient appear artificial or enhanced to the naked eye. Good Craftsmanship bionics may be relatively unobtrusive when wearing civilian garb; they might be visible to the naked eye but appear neatly sculpted and clean in their integration. Best Craftsmanship bionics might be works of art, inlaid with gold and brass within an area, performing dazzling feats adorned with prayer scrolls, making them visible with hieratec markings, colored adornments, and other contributions to the dilution of \"flesh is weak.\" Finally, Poor Craftsmanship bionics are bulky and obvious, requiring increased care and maintenance."

      "text": "IMPLANT SYSTEMS\nWhat follows are the more widely available bionic and implant systems. Note that certain advanced or esoteric types of body augmetics are much rarer (and sometimes heretical in nature), and characters who possess numerous bionic implants usually have higher authority within the Imperium's social hierarchy. Most modifications to believers with cybernetics are usually reserved for those deemed worthy, particularly those stationed in important positions within the Imperium, those among the Adeptus Mechanicus, or other special cases.\n\nBIONIC ARM\nCommon versions of these systems mirror the function of the arm outlining a bone structure exactly resembling its human counterpart in terms of dexterity and general manipulation. Better versions make the owner's Agility score +2 in matters of fine dexterity and manual manipulation (such as Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Actions with that arm). Good bionic arms provide a +10 bonus to Agility Tests requiring concentration and using one hand. Additionally, wielding a bionic arm can also allow the user to reroll failed Strength Tests when using that hand.\n\nAUGER ARRAYS\nThese cybernetic devices duplicate the effects of using a hand-held auspex device (page 147). Modern systems function as a full auspex with motion detection ability (either thermal or electromagnetic) and have a limited range of 20 metres. Good systems function as a full auspex and grant a +10 bonus to Perception-based Tests when using its functions.\n\nAUGMENTED SENSES\nThis catch-all category includes additional neural and cerebral processing that enhances the character's Movement Rates. Bionic locomotion can make the character's Movement Rates +1 when running, and +10 to any appropriate Agility Test when the action involves Movement. This collection can include biometal leg structures, good craftsman models that increase the Sprint Action by 10m.\n\nBALEFUL EYE\nEach baleful eye has been passed down for centuries within the Mechanicus, reclaimed by the Machine Cult from ancient millennia. Common versions might be custom-fitted, while Good versions are intimidating, granting a +10 bonus to all Silent Move checks. Characters with this implant have enhanced perception using the device. The baleful eye grants the character's Perception skill while his hands are full. The baleful eye may function as a talisman for the psyker, acting as a Psy-focus when performing Witch Sight Tests. The baleful eye also acts as a blood-linked to symbols written long before their creators perished in wars fought centuries ago.\n\nBALLISTIC MECHADENDRITE\nThis solid, shoulder-mounted mechadendrite is designed to act as a tertiary combat arm, fitted with a weapon of Adeptus Mechanicus design. This weapon counts as having the Compact upgrade (see page 136). This mechadendrite has its own Reaction for the Round or as a Half Action (see page 238 to learn more), but it can only be fired once per Round unless the character has the Tech-Priest trait and has the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to operate this implant."

      "text": "BIONIC HEART\nA prepared replacement when the flesh starts failing, the bionic heart is both a strong pump (with three redundancies) keeping the blood circulating through the body and a last line of defense. Superior artificial arterial pumps flow through this like stroke & eight catastrophes without implant harm. +1 Toughness to the Body location and a bonus when fighting off cellular poisons and disease that might enter the bloodstream.\n\nCALCULUS LOGI UPGRADE\nMiniature Calculus Logi circuits are implanted directly into the brain through skull cut-bits, machinetech replacing functionality previously thought to be strictly limited to the capabilities of a normal human brain. The implant grants the user Logic abilities similar to the Calculus Logi talent.\n\nCORTEX IMPLANTS\nThese are highly debilitating and extremely invasive modifications to the recipient. These artificial cortex implants cancel personality and normal human functionality. The implant adds a total of 1d10 points from the core's Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Agility, Intelligence, Perception, and Willpower characteristics. During character creation, this is important. But destroys the personality and removes considerable identity, making them more like servitor than person. Good cortex implants are forbidden among the Mechanicus except to servitors. A state of near programmed automata with a +2 to Intelligence (+3 for Best craftsmanship) performing calculations and intricate puzzle solving when information has been directly fed into their matrixes.\n\nCRANIAL ARMOUR\nThis augmentation covers the surface most of the skull with a layer of ceramite steel plating, designed to better protect the brain from trauma. This implant adds 2 armour points to the user's Head location.\n\nCYBERNETIC SENSES\nSight, hearing, smell, taste—all can be artificially enhanced to make the recipient more acute in their perception range. Common cybernetic senses approximate human qualities of senses but greatly enhance acuity and precision; occasionally also providing much longer ranges (hearing infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies, low-resolution infrared and ultraviolet sight, etc.). Good cybernetic senses grant a +10 bonus to Perception Tests based on the appropriate sense (hearing, smell, vision, etc.).\n\nMEDICAE MECHADENDRITE\nThis four-meter flexible limb is designed to assist the Omnissiah's clerics in medical and surgical procedures in the field. The limb grants a +10 bonus to Medicae Tests. The mechadendrite houses six injectors or fluid dispensers, each of which may be filled with one dose of a drug, deaddening toxins, or the like. These must be supplied separately. In addition, the limb contains a variety of medical tools designed to provide first aid; the mechadendrite's flash sampler may incorporate membrane tentacles for blood testing. A Half Action chainscalpel (as for details in Chapter IX, Playing the Game, Page 269) and a photo-audio link attachment reduce the difficulty of implant insertion (treating it with the Ease modifier, see Chapter VII: Playing the Game, Page 234). Likewise, these tools are commonly Advanced recantilic technical-neurotic devices and deals 1d5 Rending Damage. Finally, internal micro-bead systems of the Medicae mechadendrite may function as a voxnal interrogation set. This mechadendrite may be shoulder-mounted, and characters must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to operate this implant.\n\nLOCATOR MATRIX\nMicro-cogitators implanted in the skull allow the bearer to know the direction of magnetic north, present elevation, atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and electrical charge levels. The user can take a Half Action to determine his exact location relative to terrain features and planetary bodies (to determine from this information, the bearer must make a Challenging (+0) Navigation planet-based or Logic Test)."

      "text": "MANIPULATOR MECHADENDRITE\nA powerful shoulder-mounted mechadendrite designed for lifting, transporting, and manipulating heavy machinery. Each cylindrical limb is neurally linked with the user and contains magnetically powered servos and gripping, pincer-like ends. These may be locked around anchor points, enabling users to climb high gantries or acting as a platform for firing heavy weapons. Finally, the manipulator counts as a Full Action weapon that deals 1d10+2 Impact Damage and is unwieldy; the manipulator requires fine-grained manipulation such as typing or handling delicate matrices or other precise manipulations before the character performs the action. The character must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to operate this implant.\n\nMIND IMPULSE UNIT (MIU)\nThese implants rely on subdermal induction ports that can interface directly with a technological device. MIUs are commonplace among the Adeptus Mechanicus, who regard them as physical signs of devotion to the Machine God. An MIU implant enables using a Mind Impulse Unit for controlling equipment. Most commonly these include weapon systems, cogitators, tools, and other mechanisms; an MIU adds +10 to Tech-Use Tests. Poor MIU systems require a monthly Willpower Test and have a 5% chance of causing mild synaptic damage; Good models grant a bonded communion with machine-spirits as a +20 bonus to Tech-Use Tests. Logic-inquiry fusion cells are built into class seven logic arrays.\n\nMIU WEAPON INTERFACE\nUnlike the standard wired neural jacks favoured by the Adeptus Mechanicus, this rare simpler piece allows a user to remotely communicate and control a weapon while still using their hands for other tasks. A character with a MIU weapon interface gains a +10 bonus to Ballistic Skill Tests when firing a weapon linked to the MIU weapon interface, and when using the Push action with the MIU weapon interface; in addition, the character has his full Ballistic Skill while moving when operating as though the weapon was braced.\n\nOPTICS MECHADENDRITE\nThe highly articulated mechadendrite functions like a prehensile probe of metallic grasping needles and light-sensitive visual lenses. The prehensility mounted mechadendrite allows the user to extend around corners or examine surfaces with microscopic detail. The mechadendrite is also mounted with infra-red receptors and sensors, enabling the character using the mechadendrite to gain Dark Sight in areas of low visibility. When used in this fashion, the mechadendrite adds a +10 bonus to Perception Tests. The optics mechadendrite may be used to help resolve matters related to engineering, broading colors, determining smaller materials, or distinguishing materials. The optics mechadendrite may be shoulder-mounted; the character must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to operate this implant.\n\nSYNTHETIC MUSCLE GRAFTS\nVat-grown muscle tissue created, strengthened, and augmented before implanted through surgical methods, allowing for enhanced Strength. A normal implantation grants the wearer +1 Strength. A Good-craftsmanship will grant the Unnatural Strength (x2) Trait but also imposes a -10 penalty to any Agility Tests (due to restrained muscle movement).\n\nRESPIRATORY FILTER IMPLANT\nA series of micro-filters inside the lungs can filter out toxic gases inhaled. Particulate matter is also filtered, making breathing heavily polluted atmosphere less taxing. This implant grants a +20 bonus to Toughness Tests to resist toxins or airborne hazards.\n\nUTILITY MECHADENDRITE\nA two-metre flexible limb designed for tech-use operations, utility mechadendrites have compatible tools for repairing and maintaining machinery. The mechadendrite grants a +10 bonus to Tech-Use Tests. The limb also houses an injector or fluid dispenser, each of which may be fitted with one data-cell or ungent. These must be supplied separately. In addition, the limb contains various precision tools and implements, which are especially useful for identifying particularly troublesome faults. The limb includes an interface spike for direct data access (see Tech-Use on page 98). The utility mechadendrite may be shoulder-mounted; the character must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to operate this implant."

Astropathic broadcasts are essential, even though messages may be delayed, mangled, and incomplete. Even lost. Yet without the astropaths and what few can manage, the Imperium itself would be impossible. After millennia, astropaths continue communicating across the gulfs of space, from sealed fortress worlds to the blazing Regions Solar. Just as important, they determine whether or not a ship has truly arrived where the Navigator claims to have guided it.\n\nFor Rogue Traders, these psykers offer perfect means of communication with their far-flung operations while the warship continues its exploration of the Koronus Expanse. All across the Imperium, millions of astropaths serve, each linked in incredible ways to the God-Emperor. They remain, however, as mortal as any Explorer, tainted with the dangers of the psyker's gift—pierced through by the Emperor in a binding ritual known as \"Soul Binding\". Every astropath is a psyker, a connection to terrifying depths of the empyrean. The astropath's soul is brought to the Emperor, causing terrible loss to their physical forms and practically guaranteeing blindness. But allowing the Imperium to function as a coherent society across its disparate holdings.\n\nHigh Terra's Adeptus Astra Telepathica oversees the training and development of astropaths and maintains the Leagues of Astropaths, stationed on worlds throughout the galaxy. The Astropath Plenipotentiary of the Adeptus Terra manages astropaths themselves, who are born with the Psyker's gift, taken by the Inquisition's Black Ships of the Imperium or sent to them by other means. Once their gifts have been recognized and found to meet certain criteria, candidates undergo extensive training, culminating in a great psychic ritual known as Soul Binding—a process which forever links them with the God-Emperor. This terrifying process shields their souls against the madness hidden in the dimension of Chaos, enabling the astropath to direct their telepathic powers without succumbing to the whispered words of dark powers. But the protection comes with terrible risks. The touch from the Holy Emperor burns out the astropath's eyes, blinding them; yet this same ritual allows astropaths to sense and communicate from planet to planet and sometimes between solar systems.\n\nThe benefits of Soul Binding extend beyond merely enabling astropaths to operate without significant risk; this also allows the astropath to pierce the howling immaterium—yet this binding dramatically changes their quality of existence. Physically weakened, psychic predictions often fail to penetrate the warp's interfering veil. Typically astropaths appear as normal humans except for their disturbing whited-out eyes; in some cases, astropaths look entirely normal, with the binding and ritual transforming them fundamentally. Combined with a psyker's own abilities, this transforms the psyker, protecting him in a way that makes astropaths unique among psykers in the galaxy.\n\nIMPERIAL SANCTIONED PSYKERS\nEven though the Imperium fears and distrusts the vast majority of psykers, some have been inducted into service to the Imperium, culling the daemons surrounding these potentially dangerous beings. Their survival was made possible by a stringent process of training, indoctrination, testing, culling, and control processes similar but nowhere near as thorough or all-encompassing as the binding ritual undergone by astropaths.\n\nTYPES OF PSYKERS\nDespite the superstitious fear and hatred with which most individuals in the Imperium treat psykers, some of these fill vital and revered functions that help the Imperium's war effort remain effective. Other sanctioned psykers come to dominate through fear, depending on the path the psyker's future will take. These essential individuals that utilize psychic powers—some of these fill vital and revered functions within the Imperium's armed forces, while others remain outcasts, reviled and feared. Unsanctioned psykers are considered a blight on Imperial society; psykers caught using their powers can be executed under several Imperial laws."

Across the breadth of the Imperium and indeed beyond, there persist within each generation a number of individuals whose latent abilities have not yet fully manifested. They manifest as an individual reaching adolescence or adulthood, both under and over these formations, indeed often haunted by dark voices never seen. Even the Emperor's otherworldly vigilance cannot detect them all. Entirely many remain undetected latent Psykers found by their abilities by those reaching into near-hovering points about death. Their role in the universe unfortunately exists whether they know it or not. Each human and the Ministorum to which they belong must eradicate those who attempt to use them. With latent powers their psychic potential growing advanced and Origin. As a way of the warp, these individuals often have their handily to them ease properly, though the Black Ships that patrol the Imperium and return them to Terra. A process of culling and sorting sacrifices their gifts to either feed into the astronomican or become fully gifted with Psychic Powers that serve singular purpose and acuity enabling them to safely navigate the ship through the warp without a Navigator alike. Their noble houses form the Imperial Navigator Nobilite, which has evolved its blood over generations through selective breeding. Those that possess the Gift of the Adeptus Astranica (or are chosen by the Adeptus Mechanicus) enter Imperial society, from the commissariat to the Adeptus Ministorum (with the highest of Terra). By burning out the minds of these lesser Psykers into the Astronomican, the Emperor's Golden Throne sends a brilliant light flaring through the warp, providing stable fixed points Astronomican with which to navigate.\n\nXENOS PSYKERS\nOutside the Imperium, a multitude of alien races exist with Psykers of their own, although these alien psykers typically manifest different forms and ranges of ability than their human counterparts. From the brutish, thunderous power of the greenskin \"weirdboyz\" to the menacing brilliance of Eldar farseers and warlocks, these xenos pose powers both powerful but also feared by their own race in common with their human cousins. Their mastery of the psyker's arts has developed in myriad ways both alike to mankind's and made wholly alien. Mankind will never again be able to match the bright-burning power of their corrupt alien cousins, although worlds completely outside the Imperium might still be unaware of the perils presented by unfettered warp contact.\n\nUNTOUCHABLES\nThe full manifestation of psychic powers comes to those who can exert some degree of control. Known as \"Blanks\" or \"Pariahs,\" the untouchables are completely the opposite. They instead act as a dampening presence to psychic activity, lessening and helping suppress its effects. Untouchables are frighteningly powerful, as some psykers actually become quite ill in their presence. Untouchables exist at various degrees of potency, and their very presence makes them folk to be shunned by others. Often loners, outcasts and mentally withdrawn, their isolation often comes from the discomfort felt by those around them. One can imagine the impact this has from birth, leaving them far removed from the mob that would burn the witch.\n\nSORCERERS\nThere are psykers who come into their own without some terrible breakthrough in their physical body or mind, their inherent connections to the warp. These individuals are strong enough to resist the extreme dangers that accompany psychic powers without undergoing formal purification processes. Dawn into power, these cult-leaders and seers fulfill human needs by wielding their psychic abilities, resisting the temptations of the warp and horror forth having central control. A necessary fact for heresy-stamping to manifest services is that a psyker's powers emerge from the first full emergence of his powers until he is identified, a bloody eruptive flowing following that he often counted too notorious. Weak psykers can exist from place to place with little experience of stress at all; the greater the power, the more the Immaterium tears open during moments of extreme emotional overflowing.\n\nTHE SCHOLASTICA PSYKANA\nThroughout the Imperium, there exist scattered universities of the mind, where fundamental principles are codified under Inquisition scrutiny. Within civilized society the Scholastica Psykana stands as the Imperium's elite collegiate training ground for human psykers. Inquisition-approved teachers impart the standard anti-corruption and discipline worthy to the Imperium. To honor their own sacrifice and to differentiate themselves from untrained sources, students enrolled in the Scholastica Psykana undergo testing and culling designed to eradicate the weak and generally separate potential Alpha grade psykers; this system is also put to use during expeditions to the Koronus Expanse. Perhaps given the obsession with power, many students never fully graduate during their tenure, with many finding their ultimate and singular vocation."

      "text": "STARTING PSY RATING AND PSYCHIC TECHNIQUES\nPsykers built as presented here start with a Psy Rating of 2 and may increase this rating to 6 through character advancement (see Chapter III: Career Path). Characters with Unnatural Willpower (see page 381) make for shockingly powerful psykers, since that characteristic directly affects both a psyker's Psy Rating and the success of his psychic techniques.\n\nPSYCHIC TECHNIQUES\nPsychic techniques are divided into Disciplines. Each Discipline encompasses all psychic techniques a psyker can learn in that category (see Pushing Psychic Techniques). A psyker can have multiple powers from multiple Disciplines, but the techniques themselves are mostly tied to one specific Discipline.\n\nPushing Psychic Techniques\nThe psyker can temporarily push his psychic technique by increasing the effective Psy Rating of the technique. This represents the Psyker drawing more deeply upon the warp. Sanctioned psykers may push up to their Willpower Bonus. Other psykers have a less controlled connection to the warp and push their final Psy rating by a significantly greater amount (see Push on Table 6-1: Psychic Strength), but at an even greater risk of harm.\n\nUSING PSYCHIC TECHNIQUES\nWhenever a psyker uses a psychic technique, he must focus his will to try to channel the energies of the warp into a psychic ability. When the psyker draws out this energy from the immaterium, he creates disturbances in the warp, minimizing danger with carefully concentrated mental energy.\n\nEXAMPLE\nAn astropath with a Willpower of 42 (WP Bonus of 4) and Psy Rating of 3 applies Psychic Strength to call forth psy-force drawn from the Raging Warp (Focus Power Action, see page 239). This mental action has a Psy Rating of 3, but the psyker can push his Psy Rating up to 7 (Psy Rating 3 + WP Bonus 4). The psyker's Focus Power Test is a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test.\n\nUsing a psychic technique requires a Focus Power Action (see page 239). This action is a Willpower Test modified by factors related to the technique's strength. The psyker must roll equal to or lower than his Willpower to successfully channel the power, though a natural roll of 96 or higher on this Test always indicates failure.\n\nTABLE 6-1: PSYCHIC STRENGTH\nFettered | Unfettered | Push\n---------|------------|-----\n(Psy Rating) | (Psy Rating × 2) | (Psy Rating × 3) + 4\n\nPsykers gain Fettered, Unfettered, or Push strength equal to the value derived from the listed formula; these values may affect attributes like Power, Range, Duration, and other qualities.\n\nPower: This value represents the raw psychic strength channeled into a technique. Each technique's description indicates how to derive the Power value.\n\nSustaining Multiple Powers\nPsykers can Focus Power to sustain multiple techniques simultaneously, but each additional power maintained reduces the psyker's effective Psy Rating by 1. Maintaining two powers reduces effective Psy Rating by 1, maintaining three powers reduces effective Psy Rating by 2, and so on.\n\nMaintaining a power automatically fails if the psyker's Psy Rating drops to 0 or lower—the power is no longer sustainable and has the appropriate psychic phenomena test triggered. Maintaining multiple techniques incurs the penalty until the psyker ceases sustaining the power.\n\nCumulative Effect\nEach psyker using the same psychic technique adds a +10 bonus per additional psyker to the collective Characteristic or Skill Test the technique affects. The Game Master may modify the effect at his discretion based on special circumstances.\n\nRange and Line of Sight\nUnless stated in their descriptions, psychic powers that are targeted directly against other individuals require line of sight of the target and other targets within the power's stated Range.\n\nOpposed Tests\nWhen psychic powers target multiple targets, each individual makes an Opposed Test against his Willpower when resisting the power's effects. Handle each of those opposing the psyker individually as well; if they all fail, then they all succumb to the technique.\n\nMIU Weapon Interface; Special Ability or other character talent; Psychic Power: special ability where another character assists once on their behalf to speed things along.

      "text": "Discipline Mastery\nWhen a psyker has increased techniques or when ancient inscribed crumbling scrolls within a noble's librarium have disclosed simple Discipline Mastery, that Discipline adds +1 to Psy Rating when calculating Psychic Strength for all of the technique's attributes and an additional effect from Unfettered or Push Psy Rating of 3.\n\nPSYCHIC TECHNIQUES\nBasic Techniques for each Psychic Discipline represent the most fundamental disciplines. Telepathy allows the psyker to accumulate strong border skills only. For example, a psyker can purchase all the Telepathy techniques that belong to the Mind's Eye tree and all the Telepathy powers that open doors to her future development. The techniques that belong to the same tree represent different abilities within a simple psychic talent.\n\nPower Scale\nPsykers gain increasingly strong effects; the relative strength of the technique directly correlates with the Psychic Strength value from Table 6-1: Psychic Strength, regardless of what Psychic Strength one will choose to calculate the technique's effects.\n\nPSYCHIC PHENOMENA\nJust as the chance of the empyrean bleeding into reality increases when a psyker succeeds with a Focus Power Test, so too does the chance of warping causality in this expression of the warp. While unpredictable, many possible effects have been noted including vegetation slowly quieting all at once, local weather suddenly changing, or even full scale warp breaches with the direct involvement of empyric entities. When performing psychic phenomena, see Focus Power and Table 6-2: Psychic Phenomena for details.\n\nAstropathic Choirs\nAstropaths work together in choir-formation to empower the powers of one specific Astropath. Having an Astropath Transcendent roll an additional dice for Perils of the Warp rolls and may discard any one d10 for a more favorable roll has many advantages. Sometimes the Astropath can sustain greater psychic strength or power. Astropaths working in choirs often help each other when performing difficult astropathic techniques with the psyker's own talent.\n\nTABLE 6-2: PSYCHIC PHENOMENA\nRoll | Effect\n-----|-------\n01-08 | Light Show: Nothing untowarded happened. The air around the psyker shimmers slightly as it is caressed by the warp. The psyker suffers no ill effects.\n09-15 | Warp Whispers: Voices of spite and hatred whisper from beyond. All characters within 3d10 metres must make a Routine (+20) Willpower Test or become agitated. Characters that pass the Test remain immune to this effect for 24 hours.\n16-24 | Haunting Breeze: Ethereal winds eddied around the psyker, blowing ghostly but still physical things through the air. Loose items are caught in the winds and tossed about.\n25-30 | Unnatural Darkness: For a brief moment, all light within 25 metres of the psyker is extinguished as shadows push through reality.\n31-37 | Breath Leech: The air around the psyker stagnates as oxygen seems to be leached from it. Every living being (including the psyker) within 3d10 metres must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or gain 1 level of Fatigue.\n38-45 | Daemonic Mask: The psyker's face twists into a horrifying daemonic visage for a moment. Anyone who sees the psyker must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or gain 1 Insanity Point.\n46-54 | Blood Price: Blood weeps from nearby stone and metal within a 3d10 metres radius of the psyker. The blood is not real, and evaporates with strange motes of crimson light.\n55-63 | Distorted Reflections: For a moment, reflective surfaces within line of sight portray horrible twisted versions of those reflected therein. Anyone who sees this must make a Routine (+20) Willpower Test or gain 1 Insanity Point.\n64-72 | Falling Upwards: Everything near the psyker (including the psyker himself) that isn't bolted down rises into the air. Characters caught in the area must make a Challenging (+0) Strength Test or be knocked to the ground. In addition to howling winds and flickering lights, any psychic technique the psyker was attempting automatically fails.\n73-82 | Glimpse of the Warp: Daemons cavort and play on the edge of the shadows. Everyone within 1d100 metres must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or gain 1 Insanity Point.\n83-90 | Warp Ghosts: Echoes of creatures from the warp emerge and silently act out scenes from their ancient past. The Machine Spirits rebel as all electrical tech within 5d10 metres ceases functioning for one Round (see Chapter IX: Playing the Game, page 238). Characters caught within the phenomena's area (except the psyker) must make a Routine (+20) Toughness Test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue.\n91-98 | The Gibbering: All sentient beings (including the psyker) within 4d10 metres must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or suffer 1d5 Corruption Points. All those who fail also suffer a -10 penalty to Willpower Tests for the next hour.\n99 | Psychneuein Attack: A herald of the warp appears where the psyker stands, as parasitic warp entity coalesces out of thin air, unmindful of what drew it. The psyker must make a Very Hard (-30) Willpower Test. Success indicates the spirit departs without incident. If the test fails, he suffers 1d10 Energy Damage (ignoring Armour) and must check for other possible complications from this failed attack—cumulative with other effects from this table.\n100 | Perils of the Warp: The psyker has drawn too deeply from the warp and caught the attention of the Ruinous Powers.

If he fails, he is stunned for 1d5 Rounds and cannot use any psychic powers until this effect ends.\n10-19 | Nosebleed: Running from nose, eyes, and ears, the psyker bleeds as he feels a numb sense of detachment. The psyker must make a Routine (+20) Willpower Test. Failure indicates he takes 1d5 Energy Damage (ignoring Armour) and must immediately end all current psychic powers.\n20-29 | Soul Sear: Cold air forms around the psyker flowing outward, coating everything in frost. The psyker suffers 1d10 points of Energy Damage ignoring Armour. Make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test. If he fails, he also suffers 1 Corruption Point.\n30-39 | Mental Purge: The psyker falls back as if struck by an invisible hand, suddenly dropping to the ground. The psyker is stunned for 1d5 Rounds.

Anyone within 4d10 metres of the psyker (including the psyker himself) must make a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test or suffer 1d5 Insanity Points.\n60-69 | Ethereal Shouting: A terrible scream erupts from the psyker's mouth as warp energy tears his psyche. Anyone within 3d10 metres must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test. If they fail, they immediately become Stunned for 1d5 Rounds—the psyker included—and he must end all maintained powers.\n70-79 | Chaotic Possession: A random being (not the psyker) immediately adjacent to him becomes the channel for some alien consciousness, intruding from the warp. This cannot be a daemon or untouchable, but it can affect other sentient beings within the warp. Characters with the Daemon or Untouchable Traits are immune. Anyone affected suffers 1d5 Corruption Points and must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test.

Everyone (including the psyker) within 1d100 metres must make a Challenging (+0) Strength Test or be knocked to the ground. In addition to howling winds and flickering blood falling horizontally, any psychic powers in use fail immediately. Every character within 1d10 metres of the psyker's location suffers 1d10 Energy Damage and 1d10 points of the psyker's choice. This effect lasts for 1d5 Rounds.\n90-94 | Daemonic Possession: The psyker is directly touched by creatures of the warp reading his mind and forcing terrible images. Make a Hard (-20) Willpower Test. If the psyker fails, a minor daemon inhabits his body temporarily and attempts to use his abilities to create havoc. When the Hard Willpower Test is failed, a GM takes control of the psyker for 1d10 Rounds. While being controlled, the psyker can use his Focus Power to attempt to cast any psychic power the GM wishes. After the effect ends, the psyker suffers 1d10 insanity points and 1d5 Corruption Points. See the possession rules on page 268 for greater complications from this form of daemonic possession.\n95-100 | Taken by the Warp: A huge rift opens that threatens to consume the psyker and those nearby. The warp swallows the psyker. Consult your GM as to whether he/she dies, reappears elsewhere, or suffers some other dire fate. There is a 10% chance any character within d10 metres of the psyker's location is also swallowed by the rift."

      "text": "EXAMPLE\nDetecting Psychic Techniques\nWhen a psyker focuses his mind and channels the power of the Immaterium, other psykers dipping into the flow of the warp may notice the eddies caused by the intrusion. Psykers can make a Psyniscience Test to detect when other Psychic Techniques manifest in their presence. This is a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test with modifiers based on the Psychic Strength level being used (at the GM's discretion). When something Unfettered occurs within range of a psyker's Focus Power, for example, the GM may add or subtract from the Test requirement. When a psychic technique pushes a Psychic Phenomena check, the Unfettered Psychic Strength level automatically adds a +10 modifier to the Psyniscience Test.\n\nPSYCHIC DISCIPLINES\nThere are many different psychic disciplines in existence; far too many to chronicle here, likely as numerous and varied as the human imagination itself. Common psychic powers include telepathy (the communication between one mind and another), and more occult arts such as the destructive molecular manipulation that destroys human flesh as easily as it transmutes elements. The connection to daemons and psychic strength are also translated abilities usually begun with a basic, almost rudimentary form of the power. As these techniques grow in the psychic discipline, the psyker discovers increasingly strong links with the power.\n\nThis represents three Psychic Disciplines in detail, which are most prevalent among Astropaths, though these are not the only powers known:\n\nTelepathy: The art of mental communication, detection of other thoughts, and devices and—in addition—this discipline includes influencing another's mind, either through careful suggestion or forceful domination.\n\nDivination: Reading the strands of the future or the most likely paths from the present; the most common lot of the astropath in their spacious and difficult travels among the stars.\n\nTelekinesis: Turning thought into force; this discipline appears small when in effect, as well as powerful and fiery among Imperial servants. Each Discipline maintains a Psy Rating of 3.\n\nASTROPATHS AND THE PROTECTION OF SOUL BINDING\nThe astropath receives divine protection through soul binding with the Emperor that most psykers lack. The benefits of this protection manifest when the astropath uses telepathic powers that involve mind control or possession onto another being. The astropath receives a +20 bonus to his Willpower Test when resisting Mind Probes and Mind Control techniques. Also, if an astropath fails a Willpower Test to resist possession or other similar effects, he may re-roll the test once. This is an instance where the Talent: Psychic Power; special ability or other character talent; Psychic Power: special ability where another character assists once on their behalf to speed things along.

Every character within 1d10 metres of the psyker's location suffers 1d10 Energy Damage and 1d10 points of the psyker's choice. This effect lasts for 1d5 Rounds.\n90-94 | Daemonic Possession: The psyker is directly touched by creatures of the warp reading his mind and forcing terrible images. Make a Hard (-20) Willpower Test. If the psyker fails, a minor daemon inhabits his body temporarily and attempts to use his abilities to create havoc. When the Hard Willpower Test is failed, the GM takes control of the psyker for 1d10 Rounds. While being controlled, the psyker can use his Focus Power to attempt to cast any psychic power the GM wishes. After the effect ends, the psyker suffers 1d10 insanity points and 1d5 Corruption Points. See the possession rules on page 268 for greater complications from this form of daemonic possession.\n95-100 | Taken by the Warp: A huge rift opens that threatens to consume the psyker and those nearby. The warp swallows the psyker. Consult your GM as to whether he/she dies, reappears elsewhere, or suffers some other dire fate. There is a 10% chance any character within d10 metres of the psyker's location is also swallowed by the rift."

      "text": "PSYCHIC DISCIPLINES\nTHE TELEPATHY DISCIPLINE\nActivation Time: Half Action\nMaintainable: Yes\nRange: 10m × Psy Rating\nFocus Power Test: No\nPower Scale: At Psy Rating 1-2, the psyker can only send and receive verbal communications but no images. At Psy Rating 3+, the psyker can receive visual communications. Images will only be black and white, with a dreamlike quality; higher than that, images will be in colour accompanied by appropriate sound. Communication higher than Fettered Psychic Strength level will come across as \"shouting\" unless carefully modulated.\nTechnique Trees: Communication, Domination\n\nBasic Technique: Thought Sending\nThe psyker can push his thoughts into the minds of those around him. This can be directed at either individual minds he is familiar with within range, or a generalized broadcast to all minds within range indiscriminately (at the psyker's discretion). Much like the telepathic \"language\" barrier, telepathy attempted without a clear language suffers penalties to the astropath's \"signal strength\" and strongly dilutes what is being sent. Every mind who receives such communications--average souls across the galaxy may transmit images with soundbytes rich in detail. Opposed Willpower Tests determine successful transmission of his power, determined by his Psy Rating (see Table 6-5: Astral Signals). After this distance, the signal will sharply degrade, imposing penalties to understand per additional range bracket until the signal dissolves into nothingness.\n\nSpecial Power: Astral Telepathy\nValue: Free (Astropaths only)\nPrerequisites: Soul-bound to the Emperor\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nPicking up astropathic communication intended for targets within visual range requires a Routine (+20) Psyniscience Test for another Astropath. For communicative Safe Receipt, this becomes a Challenging (+0) Psyniscience Test for information about ordinary life, and a Difficult (-10) Psyniscience Test if the communication involves death or combat. Astray communication requires careful concentration, meditation, and freedom from distracting circumstances. Using this technique during combat would impose a -30 penalty to the Focus Power Test. Astropathic communication over interstellar distances normally takes 1d5 hours (this timing may be adjusted at the GM's discretion based on length and complexity of the message). Astropathic communication is never truly reliable, with \"sending\" and \"receiving\" messages often becoming lost or hopeless garbled. Over time, successful results transmit messages sent over long distances as often a packet of information akin to a brief recording from the real world, absorbed and clutched by their will (hopefully) caught and safely relayed beyond their astral understanding. This process is not instantaneous. However, to transmit accurately, the Focus Power Test must succeed or the Psyker must wait 1d5 hours before he can try the process again.\n\nTelepathic Communication Techniques\n\nMental Bond\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Mind Link\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: Psy Rating km\nA permanent mental link is formed between the psyker and a willing target. No effort is needed to establish or maintain the link; it automatically works when the Psyker and his target are within range of each other and wish to use it to communicate. The psyker can only maintain one Mental Bond at a time. If the target dies, the bond is dissolved and the psyker suffers 1d10 Insanity Points from the backlash. If the psyker wants to eliminate the Bond at any time, he must succeed on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test.\n\nMind's Eye\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nA successful Focus Power Test allows the psyker to establish a Fettered Strength communication link for a number of willing minds equal to his Willpower Bonus. This technique does not require line of sight.\n\nMind Link\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: None\nThis technique allows the psyker to increase the range of all of his Telepathic communications (with the exception of Astral Telepathy) by 1d10 × 10%. Thus standard Telepathy would have a range of 110%-200% of normal, and short-range Telepathy would be 110%-200% of normal range."

As the psyker runs through the target's conscious memories over the past day, notable emotional attachments become accessible to him, such as simple paranoia or recent experiences the target might wish to keep secret from others.\nRound Three: The psyker learns detailed information about people, places, or objects that the target considers important and how they relate to each other. The target's beliefs, motivations, and personal goals are now clear to the psyker.\nRound Four: If any contact is concealing a complicated hidden agenda, pivotal memory, or the true nature of his role in the universe, that aspect of the target's mind is now an open book for the Psyker. The Psyker can also use this technique to locate mentally implanted programming.\n\nMind Probe\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nThis technique allows a psyker to feel back into other minds within range. The psyker must pass a Challenging (+0) Psyniscience Test to determine the number and location of the minds himself. The Mind Probe technique allows the psyker to dig successively deeper into the subject's mind. Each Round, the Psyker makes an Opposed Willpower Test against the target. If the psyker succeeds, he can extract information from the target's mind (see Table 6-6: Mind Probe). The psyker must win an Opposed Willpower Test to establish the forced link to the target's mind. Each Round, the Psyker digs successively deeper into the subject's mind. Untouchables are immune to this technique, as they are to all psychically-demanding powers. Also, individuals with the Resistance (Psychic Techniques) Talent inflict a -10 penalty to the Psyker's Focus Power Test (this penalty does not stack with the trait itself).\n\nIf the psyker fails the Opposed Willpower Test, the technique fails and makes probing impossible with the same target for 1 day. The failing process puts up resistance; and the target is always aware that his mind is being plundered; however, he cannot recall any knowledge the Psyker may have already learned from each level he successfully attained unless the Psyker tries a -20 Penalty on the Opposed Willpower Test to make the target unaware of the intrusion.\n\nMind Scan\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Mind's Eye, Mind Probe\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nThe psyker extends his contact and can identify other sentient minds within range. This technique does not require line of sight, auditory functions, or even direct communication with the target. Information and impressions are gathered through scanning, and the specific information the psyker receives from this technique is based on the degrees of success from the Focus Power Test:\n\nOne Success: The psyker gains a vague impression of the number of conscious minds within general proximity of his scan.\n\nTwo Successes: The psyker knows the number and location, reliability, and \"strength\" of conscious minds within the area of effect and may determine roughly what the minds themselves are thinking.\n\nThree Successes: Per two successes, plus the psyker can establish telepathic communication with any of these minds for 1d5 rounds if he desires, even with those who are not consciously attempting to communicate with him.\n\nFour or More Successes: Per three successes, plus the probe becomes a Mind Scan with range equal to Psy Rating x 100m.\n\nPsychic Scream\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Mind Probe\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nRange: 10m × Psy Rating\nBy focusing all of his will behind one massive psychic attack, a psyker can injure an opponent out to a range of 10m × Psy Rating. The Psyker must pass a Focus Power Test to hit his target, and deal 1d10 Impact Damage (with a bonus of +1 per Psy Rating) with the Shocking quality (see Page 161). The target must also make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become Stunned for a number of rounds equal to half of the psyker's Psy Rating (rounding up)."

This telepathic connection allows the Psyker to transmit a simple message.\n\nCompel\nValue: 100 XP\nPrerequisites: Delude\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nRange: 5m × Psy Rating\nThe psyker can force others briefly to act against their will. The Psyker must make an Opposed Willpower Test against the target. If the Psyker succeeds, the target must follow his commands. Commands must be simple and achievable in 1 round. Some examples include \"Stop!\", \"Fall,\" \"Attack the closest target,\" etc. If the command is potentially suicidal, the target gets a +20 bonus to the Opposed Willpower Test.\n\nFear\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisites: Mind Probe\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: (sight) × Psy Rating\nThe psyker may use his psychic abilities to flood another mind with fear and horrific images. If the Psyker succeeds on a Focus Power Test, the affected target acts as if the Psyker possessed the Fear (1) Trait. The psyker may increase the level of the Fear Trait by 1 for each simple Psychic Phenomena roll he is willing to accept.\n\nDelude\nValue: 100 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nOne of the simplest telepathic tricks, Delude allows the psyker to manipulate others into reacting favorably to him. The psyker makes an Opposed Willpower Test against his target; if he succeeds, the target will find the Psyker to be a person deserving of trust (and any friendly overtures he makes). For as long as the Psyker maintains this technique, he gains a +10 bonus to all Interaction Skill Tests against the target. Note that this technique cannot cause a psyker; the psyker cannot force others against their better judgment, harm themselves, nor take acts of overt hostility towards the Psyker.\n\nTelepathic Domination Techniques\n\nBeastmaster\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisite: None\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nThe Psyker can establish rudimentary control over animals. He can affect a number of animals (creatures with the Bestial Trait) equal to his Psy Rating. If he succeeds on an Opposed Willpower Test, the affected animals must follow his psychic commands. Even the most intelligent beast is only capable of relatively simple commands such as \"Come here,\" \"Guard me,\" \"Attack,\" etc. The animal will not follow the command if it feels threatened, severely harmed, or driven to act in a strange or counter-instinctive fashion (animals do not enter fire, etc). How the animal reacts if it breaks free of the control depends largely on how the Psyker treated the animal."

How the animal reacts if it breaks free of the control depends largely on how the Psyker treated the animal.\n\nDominate\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Compel\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nRange: Psy Rating km\nThe dreaded power of psychic domination. The psyker makes an Opposed Willpower Test against the victim, delving ever deeper into the target's mind with specific devices if needed. If the Psyker scores three degrees of success, the target willingly rejects penalties and the psyker gains +10 to the Opposed Willpower Test. If the psyker wants to use this technique to force the target to perform a task they would normally find objectionable or dangerous, he suffers a -10 penalty to the Opposed Willpower Test. Any action deemed suicidal forces another Opposed Willpower Test to try and break the control.\n\nPuppet Master\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Dominate\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nRange: Psy Rating km\nThe final expression of psychic domination. The psyker makes an Opposed Willpower Test against the victim, delving ever deeper into the target's mind with each device. If the Psyker scores three degrees of success, the target wills himself to reject penalties and the psyker gains complete control. The psyker's mind leaves his body behind and takes over the victim's body completely, whilst the victim's consciousness is suppressed in a nightmarish dream state. The target is aware that his mind is being plundered; however, he cannot recall any knowledge the Psyker may have already learned from each level he successfully attained unless the Psyker tries a -20 Penalty on the Opposed Willpower Test to make the target unaware of the intrusion.\n\nIf the distance between the Psyker and victim reaches beyond the technique's range, the Psyker returns to his own body, whilst suffering 1d5 Fatigue levels. When using this Power, which counts as a psychic technique, the psyker may not attempt this technique for 1d5 hours. This time shows the necessity of the Psyker's mind to acclimate to his own body again. The psyker's own body is vulnerable during this time; if it is severely damaged or killed, the psyker's consciousness is hurled violently out of the target's body, tearing both the ongoing control vessel—suffering 2d10 Wounds and 1d10 Insanity Points."

The target may be made to forget or misremember short term knowledge that the subject will now recall as fact.\n1 | Killer: The psyker may implant a series of false memories within the subject's mind concerning recent events. The subject will now recall an entirely different series of events or people associated with the actual memory.\n2 | History: The psyker may now supplant the target's long term memory completely and selectively, affecting potentially an entire segment of the target's synapses to reorder his perception of events and perhaps entire persons. The process may appear adequate though baseline.\n3 | Block: Breaking into the subject's deeper brain functions, the psyker may implant a psychic block that grants the target a +20 bonus to his Willpower Test when resisting Mind Probes. This also conceals the Psyker's tampering in all other areas through passing one Opposed Willpower Test.\n4 | Control: Any action deemed suicidal now only requires an Opposed Willpower Test; however, the target is now suffering shock. Rather than the psyker should the target's body be killed, the psyker's consciousness is hurled violently out of the new vessel—suffering 2d10 Wounds and 1d10 Insanity Points.\n5+ | Major Reprogramming: Given extensive time, effort, and Examination, a Psyker with this Power can freely reprogram a complete personality transforming memories, beliefs, experiences, and implants within the abilities of this power; however, the level of effort and detailed attention required to do this without overtaxing the psyker and driving the subject insane is extreme.\n\nInspire\nValue: 100 XP\nPrerequisite: None\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nThe psyker can bolster courage and quell insidious fear that he senses in any character. A number of targets equal to the psyker's Psy Rating (including the psyker himself) may immediately overcome the effects of Fear, gaining a +10 bonus to Willpower Tests to resist Fear. This effect lasts as long as the targets remain within range of the psyker's power and the Psyker maintains the power.\n\nReprogram\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Dominate, Mind Probe\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nAllowing for another psyker to control one's mind is terrifying enough; this technique takes the process to another level as the psyker insidiously reshapes the contents of the target's memories, experiences, and desires. Like controlled Dominate or Puppet Master but more subtle and elaborate, designed to reach deeper into the target's mind, this process takes 2d5 rounds to complete.\n\nThe psyker makes an Opposed Willpower Test against the target. If the psyker succeeds, he dives deep into the subject's unconscious mind. For each degree of success on the Opposed Willpower Test, the psyker receives an effect from Table 6-8: Reprogram, starting from the first result and continuing down.\n\nThe effects of Reprogramming are permanent unless they are forcibly broken down (see 'The Danger Paradox' below). During this process, the psyker inflicts 1 Fatigue level on himself. The psyker may attempt to use this power which counts as a psychic technique once per day during downtime.\n\nThe Danger Paradox: The mind is complex though rigid, and is unable to accept implanted stimuli for as long as the victim is presented with evidence to the contrary. Minor discrepancies even with what he has been manipulated into believing and the facts may break down the mental reprogramming. If the GM judges such an event has occurred, the target must succeed on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test. If the Test goes well, he has been manipulated into thinking the truth. In either case, the target suffers 1 Insanity Point."

This Power can also be used as a crude form of effective misdirection, allowing the Psyker to go unnoticed in sight, sound, or smell. The psyker may affect a number of targets up to a maximum of his Willpower Bonus. He must cut off one sense for each target. Each target makes an Opposed Willpower Test.

At Psy Rating 7+, the images will be crisp, clear and accompanied by sound.\nTechnique Trees: Emperor's Tarot, Question\n\nBasic Technique: Reading\nAfter shuffling the deck, the Psyker will read the Emperor's Tarot for the subject, divining a person's fate or the unconscious projection of his being to derive a pale shadow beneath the question asked. This is a very pale shadow beneath what most beings know before they study the Emperor's Tarot, which typically takes 30 minutes (though some readings take longer). The psyker carefully learns about any given event; each degree of success reveals more information. The psyker can attempt this as a Full Action. This requires a successful Focus Power Test, with greater degrees providing more information. The Psyker can only maintain this power for 1 hour if he wishes to divine the well-being of a different person. If the psyker maintains the power on the same target, he can increase his Degrees of Success by 1 per round cumulatively.\n\nTABLE 6-10: AURA READING\nDegrees of Success | Result\n-------------------|-------\n1 | The psyker gains superficial impressions about the target. This includes their strongest emotions the target is currently experiencing, whether or not he harbors any evil intent, and a rough idea of his state of mental and physical well-being (sound, wounded, weak, etc). Lastly, the psyker can determine if the target is a psyker or untouchable mutant in their current form.\n2 | The psyker gets deeper insight of the target including how the technique affects the target and better information about the target's feelings. The psyker gains a +10 to all Fellowship Tests made against the target while maintaining this power. Further, the psyker gets a better idea about the target's well-being, including current Wounds and Fatigue levels. Finally, the target also learns the target's Psy Rating if the target is a psyker, or if the target is a Blank, and he can determine which Disciplines and Techniques the psyker is familiar with. Additionally, the psyker can determine how many Corruption Points the target has accumulated. Also, the psyker can determine if the target has been produced through some other technologically, genetically, daemonically, or otherwise tainted process."

The psyker must have seen the person he wants to find—either in the flesh or through an image or painting—or have a fragment that has been with the person (a lock of hair, etc). The Psyker makes a Psyniscience Test modified by the following factors:\nIntimately familiar with target (knows subject well): +20\nFragment of target (hair, possessions, etc): +10\nSubject within 5 km: +10\nSubject over 5 km away: -10\nIf the psyker passes the Psyniscience Test, and the subject is within range, the psyker receives a rough idea of where the subject is located, based on how many degrees of success he scored.\n\nAlternative Path\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Divining the Future\nFocus Power Test: Awareness\nRange: Personal\nReaching this level of skill, the Psyker has learned how to explain to others or his master different outcomes from different choices and actions. The Psyker must pass a Focus Power Test with a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests; all Ballistic Skill Tests against him suffer a -10 penalty. These benefits apply for one round unless the psyker sustains the technique. Additionally, the psyker can glimpse dangers in his immediate vicinity and shout warnings to his comrades within 10m of him, warning them of incoming attacks. Allies beyond this range are outside of the scope of his power. All Ballistic Attacks against those warned suffer a -10 penalty. This technique may not be used at the Fettered Strength level.\n\nPsychometry\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Psyniscience\nLearning to read the Emperor's word upon psychic impressions, allowing the psyker to learn more about others from the psychic traces they leave behind on objects and places in the world around them. In its simplest form, this grants rough impressions about the previous owner of an object or general area. By maintaining physical contact and making a Psyniscience Test, more information beyond simple emotions may be learned. This information is gathered in successive rounds, modified by his strength. The Psyker will get the first result on the first round, the second result 10 seconds later, and so on."

However, at lower levels the Psyker's telekinesis will produce effects that people will recognize as telekinesis. This will turn into mental force at higher Psy Ratings.\nTechnique Trees: Telekinetic Force\n\nBasic Technique: Mind over Matter\nThe ability to move physical objects with the Psyker's mental gift. Telekinesis has several applications. A Psyker can lift an object within line of sight whose mass does not exceed the weight limit of 10 kg × Psy Rating. The object can move slowly within the range of the power. Additionally, this trick can function with living beings; however, being moved telekinetically can unbalance the Psyker's mental focus. Once the Psyker has lifted an object from Telekinesis, it begins to slowly settle as the last vestiges of the power ebb. These may be accelerated with greater speed if done so with lighter objects weighing 1 kg or less. The Psyker must make a Ballistic Skill Test to hit his target and deal 1d10 Impact Damage with a bonus of +1 Damage per 5 of the missile's weight in kg.\n\nPrecision Telekinesis\nValue: 100 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: 10m × Psy Rating\nWith the first gross manipulations of Telekinesis, this allows the psyker to fine tune his ability until he can do anything a hand could do. Where the task would require a Characteristic Test, the Psyker substitutes Willpower instead. Additionally, the Psyker's Willpower Bonus is used when using this technique instead.\n\nForce Bolt\nValue: 100 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: 10m × Psy Rating\nThe psyker hurls a bolt of force at an opponent. The psyker makes a Ballistic Skill Test to hit the target, and deals 1d10 Impact Damage with a bonus of +1 Damage per Psy Rating.\n\nTelekinetic Crush\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisites: None\nFocus Power Test: Opposed Willpower\nRange: 10m × Psy Rating\nThe psyker can wrap a target in crushing bands of force. Make an Opposed Test pitting the psyker's Willpower against the target's Strength or Toughness. If the psyker wins, he inflicts 1d10 Impact Damage with a bonus of +1 Damage per Psy Rating; each degree of success by which the psyker wins knocks the target down and pushes it a number of metres equal to the psyker's Willpower Bonus. The psyker may also Grapple the opponent (see page 240), substituting his Willpower bonus for his Strength bonus.\n\nTelekinetic Weapon\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisites: Force Bolt\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: Personal\nShaping the force of the psyker's mind into a blade of destructive force, the Telekinetic Weapon is a powerful manifestation of the psyker's discipline and control. The Telekinetic Weapon counts as a sword that the psyker can wield, but there is no penalty for lacking the required Weapon Training talent. The weapon forms as a hovering blade within the air. When striking with the Psychic Weapon, the psyker makes a Weapon Skill Test. The telekinetic weapon has a Damage equal to his Willpower Bonus. The force weapon is not destroyed by weapons with the Power Field quality; however, the weapon has a Penetration value equal to the Psyker's Psy Rating.\n\nTABLE 6-15: TELEKINETIC FORCE TECHNIQUES\nName | Focus Time | Sustain | XP Value | Focus Power Test\n-----|-----------|---------|----------|----------------\nPrecision Telekinesis | Half Action | Yes | 100 | Willpower\nForce Bolt | Half Action | No | 100 | Willpower\nTelekinetic Crush | Half Action | No | 200 | Opposed Willpower\nTelekinetic Weapon | Half Action | Yes | 200 | Willpower\nTelekinetic Shield | Half Action | Yes | 200 | Willpower\nStorm of Force | Half Action | No | 300 | Willpower\nForce Shards | Half Action | No | 400 | Willpower\n\nTelekinetic Shield\nValue: 200 XP\nPrerequisites: Telekinetic Crush\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: Personal\nThe Psyker can create a field of telekinetic energy for self-defense. The force-field shield grants the psyker a number of Armor Points equal to his Psy Rating. This protection counts as Armor over locations the attack strikes, and does not stack with any other armor the psyker may be wearing. The shield may be manifested and does not block sight. The defense provided by this power will still work against attacks made with weapons that have the Penetration quality.\n\nStorm of Force\nValue: 300 XP\nPrerequisites: Telekinetic Weapon\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: 30m × Psy Rating\nAs the Psyker has developed his powers to the furthest reaches of his discipline, he can manifest bolts that slash through armor and tear psychic fury. The Psyker can strike a number of targets equal to his Psy Rating. For each round the psyker maintains the power, the psyker must make a Ballistic Skill Test for each target. If successful, the psyker deals 1d10 Impact Damage with a bonus of +1 Damage per Psy Rating. No target may be hit more than once per round.\n\nForce Shards\nValue: 400 XP\nPrerequisites: Precision Telekinesis, Telekinetic Weapon\nFocus Power Test: Willpower\nRange: Personal\nThe psyker brings a number of force shards or orbiting stilettos around his body as a potential barrier against incoming attacks or opponent attacking the psyker. When striking with the force shards, the psyker makes a Ballistic Skill Test against a target with a +10 bonus, dealing 1d10 Rending Damage with a bonus of +1 Damage per Psy Rating. For each additional degree of success, the psyker hits the target with one additional force shard (to a total amount equal to his Psy Rating); each shard generates this technique separately. Additionally, the force shards gain a Penetration value equal to the Psy Rating."

      "text": "NAVIGATORS\nTHE GREAT HOUSES\nNAVIGATOR POWERS\nNAVIGATOR MUTATIONS\nNAVIGATING THE WARP\n\nCHAPTER VII:\nTHE POWER OF NAVIGATORS IN ROGUE TRADER\n\nNAVIGATORS\nRogue Trader Navigator characters stand far outside the halls of the Great Houses and the Imperial Navigator Clans. These unique individuals explore the void and the warp alongside their Rogue Trader compatriots. Though drawn from the ranks of the Great Houses of the Navis Nobilite, Navigators have a more innate and unconnected power than the average psyker; however, a Navigator's communion with the Warp is more innate and uncontrolled. Navigators have led mankind between the stars through the immaterium. Theirs is the unique power to pierce the White Warp and guide humanity through the Warp. Each Navigator possesses a limited range of abilities that differentiate them from psykers, but their powers are both more reliable and in some cases more potent. Like any within the Imperium, Navigator genes are unique, which earns them both prestige and wealth. The contemporary Navigator Houses of the Navis Nobilite have spread their influence far into the worlds of the Imperium and vaulted chambers of the High Terra. Although Navigators master all of his powers and his full influence reaches strong enough through the Great Houses of the Navis Nobilite to extend through many worlds and hallowed lineages, a typical Navigator character possesses skills befitting his privilege that no other character archetypes can come to claim; along with the strange powers they wield within their blood, their bodies typically become slowly more inhuman, their aged and wizened flesh and warped biology taken across the domain of the Emperor. They also know that both their blessing and their curse make them nobles and masters of the void and make their House hermanos and their influence they wield with the Imperium.\n\nTHE NAVIGATOR GENE\nThe origins of the Navigators have been lost to antiquity and like much of the Imperium's history have been forgotten and buried beneath the weight of millennia. It is unclear whether this unique genetic manipulation is the result of targeting elements during early mankind's first steps into the void. The truth is, whether the hand of the Emperor was behind their creation (as some claim) or whether spontaneous evolution or genetic tampering during mankind's first steps into darkness created them, Navigators can peer into the warp and guide ships through the immaterium without the Navigator Gene. The source of a Navigator's power—their gene itself—is ancient, passing through bloodlines and selective breeding. Even over ten thousand years, the gene has evolved considerably from those first few millennia. For this reason, while they wield the same gene and pulling from the same source, contemporary Navigators come in everything from elderly to ancient, some wizen beyond normal human features.\n\nTHE WARP EYE\nCommon to all Navigators is the infamous third eye, which typically manifests as individuals reach adolescence, usually on their foreheads, although some compensating with cybernetic implants. This third eye is the source of the Navigator's power; it is known as the Warp Eye, and it allows them to peer into the warp and guide ships through the immaterium. Without the Navigator Gene, ships navigating the perilous currents of the warp would be at terrible risk—most lost with all hands. Given this, it is without hyperbole to claim that without Navigators, the Imperium would collapse and mankind would lose Galactic control.\n\nIf the source of a Navigator's power comes through the gene and the Warp Eye, the manner in which they develop that power comes through training. Even when they keep their gene carefully closed, they still perpetuate ripples that can be detected by other Navigators or psykers. For this reason, though the eye is kept closed when not in use, a Navigator's Warp Gene can still be traced by those with the skill for such detections. When the eye is fully opened or fully closed, Navigators can kill, pushing fast through psychic buildings, tearing apart the unfortunate with ease. A Navigator can exert great control, causing ripples that can be detected by other Navigators all through a starship.\n\nThe existence of the Navigator's unique abilities, different from the greater mass of mankind, and their position, wealth, and breeding, affect the way they interact with others. Different from many, they remain more separated from normal people and serve a privileged position few and far between. As a result of this difference, Navigators are both feared and distrusted among commoners, even while valued for their gifts. And not without reason, as Navigators exude an aura that other people typically find disquieting; they tend to keep covered in public and seek the protection and comfort of those among their House and rank."

      "text": "THE GREAT HOUSES\nThe Great Navigator Houses of the Navis Nobilite hold a unique position within Imperial shipping, placing them in a state of privilege that stretches across the reach of the Adeptus Administratum, the Ministorum, and even the Inquisition itself. It is a position that the Great Houses have exploited down the millennia and have used to gain vast wealth and influence for themselves. Though kept separate from almost all other Imperial bodies, the Great Houses maintain political covenant in their constant struggle with each other and other Imperial agencies. Only the strict control of House traditions and the carefully maintained code that keeps Navigator conflicts from spilling out of control—a matriarch that rules over a Navigator House, the marriages and affiliations with other Houses, and careful contacts regarding the sale of Navigator services—keeps the Houses from destroying each other and themselves.\n\nAbove the petty squabbles of individual Navigator Houses, though not divorced from their feuds, stands the Novator Senatoris of the Navis Nobilite. Whilst ostensibly meant to maintain the power of the Houses and protect their interests from the interference of the Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, or Inquisition, they do far more nuanced work than that. This body is primarily motivated by the protection of the Navigator Gene, vital to ensuring the Houses continue and produce strong and potent Navigator lineages. However, the competition among the families has also led to each tampering with internal mutations of its children in the hopes of creating more powerful and able Navigators, which would give them an advantage in the galactic commerce of the Navis Nobilite. The result of these millennia of isolation and minor variances in what is still ultimately the Navigator gene is that certain powers, abilities, and mutations are strongest in specific Houses.\n\nCHOOSING YOUR LINEAGE\n\nMAGISTERIAL HOUSES\nAmong the Imperium's countless Navigator Houses, the greatest in terms of size and power are the Magisterial Houses. Each well established with ancient roots dating back thousands of years to the origins of initial Navigator families, these Houses contain many hundreds of Navigators. Though their allegiance may be slightly suspect due to their remote location, situated on the very edges of the light of the Astronomican, the Magisterial Houses maintain traditions and practices that have strengthened their bloodlines over countless millennia. Navigators of Magisterial Houses represent the finest of Navigator gene-stock, have exhibited fewer aberrant traits, and have more control over the malign mutations that plague the Navigator Gene. Some may have dwindled or died off over the millennia, while others have grown much stronger than their peers. Members of Magisterial Houses know without question the true dignity, ancient power, and nobility of their family, which stretches across the Imperium. Whilst a Magisterial House's influence in the Koronus Expanse would be small, the actual reach of the parent house on Terra is substantial and extensive.\n\nNavigator families are grouped into broad categories based on their Navigator lineages, defined by their unique paths of the Warp. In following with this division, four prime Navigator lineages are recognized within both the Calixis Sector and the Koronus Expanse—the Magisterial Houses, the Velsian Houses, the Nomadic Houses, and the Shrouded Houses. Those Navigator bloodlines that fall beyond these groups are typically shunned, known variously as the Renegade Houses.\n\nWhen selecting the Navigator for your character, there are several branches and archetypes to consider:\n\nNavigators of a Magisterial House are likely to have fewer physical mutations (see page 182). They are considered Routine (+20) when resisting gaining new mutations. Navigators of a Magisterial House also gain a +10 bonus to Fellowship Tests made against members of Imperial nobility, though most commoners find them pompous and arrogant. Navigators of a Magisterial House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation (rolled on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations below) and develop mutations more slowly than other Navigator families. Navigators from Exalted Lineages are both ancient and ancient, the Navis Nobilite nobility of the Imperium. The Navigators from these Houses would be called heralds and bannermen of their families long establishing the rightful path.\n\nNOMADIC HOUSES\nMany Navigator Houses have devoted themselves to the void, relinquishing their terrestrial holdings and spending their lifetimes plying the stars in search of profit and adventure. The Navigators of a Nomadic House are known for their untrustworthy nomadic status and uncouth attitudes, much like void-dwelling corsairs. However, as a result, these Houses have developed Navigators with a greater understanding of the warp's shifting tides.\n\nA Navigator from a Nomadic House gains a +10 bonus to all Navigation (Warp) Tests. Navigators from Nomadic Houses begin play with a single Navigator Mutation (rolled on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations below) and may choose one of the following options: Strangely Jointed Limbs, Elongated Form, Inhuman Eyes, or Void Touch. When a Navigator from a Nomadic House would acquire a new mutation (when he develops new powers or increases existing powers), he may choose to re-roll the result. The Wanderer must accept the second result, whether it is better or worse than the first. Navigator characters from Wanderer lineages automatically gain the Talented (Navigation) talent."

      "text": "SHROUDED HOUSES\nWhile the Imperium encompasses countless Navigator Houses, a great many have sunk within the tracts and divisions of the Imperium. They have over time been forgotten completely, the edges of the great and ruthless nobility that rules the cold stars barely counting their loss. It is not known where they cling—the last strands of the gene selecting for power—nor is it known what horrific compromises they may have endured as they struggle to continue. The fact that Shrouded Houses are still extant is something the Navis Nobilite would rather keep obscured. These Houses are filled with uncomfortable deviations and trade with other Houses in secret, always seeking to guide their bloodlines back to greatness.\n\nNavigators from Shrouded Houses suffer a -10 penalty to all Fellowship Tests and skills based on Fellowship when dealing with anyone outside their immediate House. Navigators from Shrouded Houses begin play with a single Navigator Mutation (rolled on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations below) and may choose one of the following options: Fleshy Coils, Deadened Flesh, or Overactive Organs. Due to their unnatural development, Navigator characters from Shrouded Houses must take a Very Easy (+30) Willpower Test when using Navigator Powers at the Adept level or higher, or suffer one Fatigue level. Shrouded Houses operate in a perpetual state of decline, their skill in finding safe paths within the warp gradually diminishing as the Astronomican grows further and fainter beyond their ability to navigate. They struggle through the shifting power of the Immaterium. While such blood may be prized by other Houses, the associated stigma of their mutations and the risks of their existence preclude these benefits.\n\nRENEGADE HOUSES\nThe strictest traditions and ancient practices of the Navigator families carry nothing when their once lauded position within the Navis Nobilite has been lost, their fortunes excoriated, their resources reduced. And so it is that Navigators from Renegade Houses within the Koronus Expanse exist, their children often heavily mutated despite their parents' attempts at breeding and understanding. This deteriorating bloodline, which leads to increasingly strange physiques and additional mutations, is plagued by a distinction that the Inquisition would take great pains to discover. The Navigator Houses which spurn various traditions and carry court within the fringes of space have birthed new strains of the gene and given rise to vastly different abilities. Far from what would be associated with this House is to have cast aside the sacred Navigator traditions of Mercantile Opportunists; the channeled and restricted gene instead embraced the galaxy. Where the Navigator Houses have spent countless generations laboriously fine-tuning their gene, the Renegades believe in constant change, the skills of hard bargaining, and control negotiation. Navigators from Renegade Houses dwell throughout the Koronus Expanse, though most of their kind are formally scattered from the Navis Nobilite through starliner captains and Navigator trait roles.\n\nNavigator characters from Renegade House bloodlines suffer a -5 penalty to Fellowship. Navigators from Renegade Houses begin play with a single Navigator Mutation (rolled on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations below) and choose one additional mutation from Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations. Navigators from Renegade Houses may be corrupted mutants competing with the Navis Nobilite for their own purposes, but their mutations have given them unexpected mental powers. Roll twice on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations when acquiring new mutations when developing Navigator Powers or increasing existing ones, and select one of the two results. When initially creating a Navigator from a Renegade House, the Navigator may choose three Navigator Powers belonging to the Novice level of power."

      "text": "GAINING NAVIGATOR POWERS\nThe Adepts and Novices of Navigator characters may access new Powers by increasing an existing one (see Page 180). These powers represent the unique gifts and deepened understanding of the Navigator Gene that all Navigator characters may develop. Each Power has three levels: Novice, Adept, and Master. These three levels reflect the Navigator's mastery over his powers and his understanding of the Warp.\n\nNavigator characters begin play with The Lidless Stare at the rank that matches their starting character (Novice) in addition to one other power of their choosing. Thereafter, each Rank (either a new power or increasing an existing power to Adept or Master) costs 200 Experience Points.\n\nINITIAL POWERS\nA Navigator character begins play with The Lidless Stare and the player's choice of one other power from the list here. The status of the Navigator Gene that allows him to navigate the Warp also protects his soul. He does not suffer Corruption Points from Warp Shock (see page 222). Although he still takes on mental strain, a Navigator can acquire Corruption Points normally from other means.\n\nUSING NAVIGATOR POWERS\nUnlike Psykers who summon energies from the warp and use arcane psychic foci to activate those energies, Navigator Powers result from their unique connection with the warp and the legacy of their genes. Because of this distinction, a Navigator character does not make Focus Power Tests or channel warp energy as a Psyker would. Instead, when using a power, a Navigator makes a characteristic Test of his choice as specified in the power's description, plus any modifiers and additional effects (or costs) noted in the power's description. The most common characteristics used for Navigator Powers are Willpower, Perception, and Fellowship in addition to Navigators adding their Perception bonus to tests (as noted in the power's description). Finally, Navigator Powers cannot be affected by effects or items that affect Psychic Powers (though Navigator Powers can still cause Corruption and Insanity Points normally).\n\nNAVIGATORS & PSYKERS?\nNavigators are not psykers in the traditional or legal sense within the Imperium, though they do have a connection with the Warp and can use their abilities. For all purposes, unless otherwise noted, Navigator Powers are considered a Standard Action to use. Note that Navigator Powers do not generate the Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp and cannot risk triggering these effects with the use of their powers. Likewise, any beings, items, or effects that would counter or increase the effects of psyker powers will have similar effects against Navigator Powers. The one change is that Navigator characters who are also Psykers will not suffer the penalties of a Psyker triggering Perils of the Warp when they use their Navigator abilities.\n\nNAVIGATOR POWERS\n\nA CLOUD IN THE WARP\nBy understanding and perceiving the currents of the Warp, the Navigator can hide his presence from those that would try to detect him within the Immaterium. Whilst active, this power reduces his Presence (or Psyniscience score) from detection by psykers as it clouds and confuses creatures whose existence depends on the Warp, such as daemons and psykers.\n\nNovice: With concentration and focus using his mental gifts, the Navigator can cloud his presence within the warp. The Navigator adds his Perception bonus as a penalty to attempts to detect him with Psyniscience or similar powers.\n\nAdept: As above, except the Navigator can attempt to mask a number of others equal to his Perception Bonus. He must cut off one target from detection for each of the Navigator's secrets he spends (see Foreshadowing below).\n\nMaster: As above, except the power gains a radius equal to the Navigator's Willpower Bonus in metres. Creatures within this radius suffer a -10 penalty to all Psyniscience Tests.\n\nFORESHADOWING\nWith consecutive study and using his Warp Eye to peer into future possibilities, the Navigator can choose to make slight adjustments for himself and his companions, helping them to avoid uncertain death and manipulate the course of the Immaterium within a radius of foresight equal to the Navigator's Perception Bonus in metres. During Starship Combat (see page 212), this power functions within a range of Void Units equal to the Navigator's Perception Bonus.\n\nNovice: After glimpsing through a myriad of possible future events, the Navigator can choose to \"spend\" a secret he has glimpsed from the Warp the following round. By spending one secret, the Navigator can add a +10 bonus to a single Test he performs. Using one secret in this way creates no danger. However, the Navigator may choose to spend either one or two secrets for an additional +10 bonus to the roll for each secret spent (to a total of +10 for one secret, +20 for each additional secret). Additional secrets may not be spent in the same hour as the first; the same hour rushing through a Navigator's vision is dangerous as no man should know too much about his own future. For every hour after the first spent using this power, the Navigator suffers 1d5 Insanity Points as paradoxes and uncertainties consume his mind.\n\nAdept: After delving through a myriad of possible futures, the Navigator can choose to \"spend\" a number of secrets equal to his Perception Bonus. Testing this power requires a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test. If successful, the Navigator can use these secrets within a number of rounds equal to his Willpower Bonus. This functions as above, however, to determine results with a +20 bonus, the Navigator must roll a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test. If this roll comes up as a failure, then the character suffers a -10 penalty instead as his mind is lost again in incoherence.\n\nMaster: As above, except secrets used to ward off threats directed at the Navigator himself will be at a +30 bonus. Used secrets are not lost or consumed; they may be used again in the following round."

      "text": "GAZE INTO THE ABYSS\nThis Power allows a Navigator to perceive a creature's or object's Immaterial Form, piercing into the warp and learning what is hidden from the real world. Using this Power, the Navigator can detect the existence of psykers, untouchables, and daemons. This power is especially potent in certain applications like locating objects and tracking powerful psychic or warp entities. This power will last a number of rounds equal to the Navigator's Willpower Bonus.\n\nNovice: With a Challenging (+0) Perception Test, the Navigator can determine if a creature or object holds the taint of the Warp. This will reveal the presence of untouchables, daemons, or psykers (though not other Navigators). If the Perception Test succeeds, the Navigator can determine if the creature or object has the Corruption Points, Mutations, or the Untouchable, Psyker, or Daemon Traits.\n\nAdept: As above, except the Navigator can also determine if a creature has made dark pacts with the Warp and daemons or carries Corruption Points. If the creature has more than 10 Corruption Points, the target must make an immediate Difficult (-10) Willpower Test opposed by the Navigator's Perception; if successful, will hide their true nature. This power can also be used to track powerful psychic or Warp creatures using the rules for Tracking (see Page 88).\n\nMaster: As above, but the Navigator can also use the power to detect true psychic powers within a radius in metres equal to double the Navigator's Perception Characteristic. Psykers may attempt to resist this detection with an Opposed Willpower Test; if successful, will hide their nature from the Navigator for 1d5 rounds.\n\nHELD IN MY GAZE\nThe unflinching eye of a Navigator locks creatures into place with a gaze that pierces flesh and bone and sees the immaterial beneath the skin. Against psykers, this ability can render them effectively powerless and prevent them from drawing upon their abilities.\n\nNovice: The Navigator makes an Opposed Willpower Test with anyone looking into his Warp Eye. Make a single Test for the Navigator and compare it to the results of each of his opponents. If the Navigator achieves more degrees of success than the opponent, they suffer 1d10+ the Navigator's Willpower bonus Energy damage. Any creature taking damage from this power is also Stunned for 1 Round.\n\nAdept: As above, except the Navigator chooses a target which is no further away than a number of metres equal to his Perception Bonus. He then makes an Opposed Willpower Test; if successful, then the target is locked in place, cannot move, and is Stunned for 1 Round. The Navigator may remain focused on the target and inflict 1 level of Fatigue per Round. The locked target must beat the Navigator in an Opposed Willpower Test to escape. If the Navigator fails this Test by one degree of failure, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue; if he fails by three or more degrees of failure, he suffers 2d10 Energy Damage. Victims of this power also suffer 1d5 Insanity Points from the warp leaking into their consciousness.\n\nMaster: As above, with the additional effect that any creature possessing an Intelligence characteristic affected by this power suffers 2d10 points of Energy damage instead of 1d10. Daemons affected by this power must make an immediate Difficult (-10) Toughness Test. If they fail, they suffer 1d10 Insanity Points when exposed to the immense Warp visions. If they pass, they suffer 1d5 Insanity Points.\n\nAvoiding the Navigator's Gaze\nThe Lidless Stare will affect anyone, friend or foe, that looks into the Navigator's third eye when this power is activated. This has an effective range of line of sight (though it's not \"beam\" or \"missile\" like in effect) and has no effect on unliving targets. Untouchables and daemonic entities are immune from the Warp. Those forewarned can try to avoid this by looking away, though even then gazing in the direction of the Navigator can be dangerous. The power of his eye sees beyond mere physical phenomena, affecting the mental world as well as the physical world. The use of this power is extremely dangerous; however, those who know they are in the presence of a Navigator using this power gain a +30 bonus to their Willpower Test while looking away or preventing the Navigator's presence from being within line of sight."

      "text": "THE COURSE UNTRAVELLED\nThrough the tangled web of infinite possibilities, The Course Un-travelled power allows a Navigator to momentarily step outside of conventional time and space. While this power is often misunderstood as teleportation, it is not such, but rather the Navigator choosing an alternate timeline in which to momentarily exist. He may only walk through this way if nothing solid exists outside the flow of time to block his way.\n\nNovice: The Navigator must make a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test; if he succeeds, he may teleport to any point within a distance equal to his Perception Characteristic in metres, choosing a space that could have been walked, climbed, or swam into normally. Whilst this Power can be instantly fatal if he fails the test, the Navigator must risk himself for the resulting change of position. If he fails this test by three Degrees or more, he is Stunned for 1d10 rounds and gains 1d5 Insanity Points.\n\nAdept: Each round the Navigator wishes to use this power, he must make a Challenging (+0) Perception Test. Whether successful or not, the Navigator suffers 1 level of Fatigue. If the test succeeds, he doubles his Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining Initiative and may take an additional Half Action on his turn. The additional Action may only be a Move Action or a Concentration Action. For Extended uses of failing the test, he halves his Agility bonus for the Round and cannot take reactions until making a successful Psychic Test, which brings him back into position.\n\nMaster: As above, however, the Navigator quadruples his Agility Bonus for the purpose of determining Initiative and may take two Extra Half Actions in addition to his other actions this round (rather than a single Half Action as per the Adept level). For Extended uses of failing the test, he halves his Agility bonus for the Round and cannot take reactions until making a successful Psychic Test, which brings him back into position.\n\nTRACKS IN THE STARS\nWhen a ship travels though either real space or the Warp, it leaves a lingering trail of disturbed space or Warp drive activation. Using his third eye, the Navigator can follow this trail across the cosmos.\n\nNovice: Using his Perception characteristic, the Navigator can trace the trail of a ship through real space in the same way a hunter uses the Tracking skill (see Page 88). Traces can be no more than a number of days old equal to the Navigator's Perception Bonus, although this duration is modified as the GM thinks appropriate.\n\nAdept: As above, however, the Navigator can follow trails that are a number of days old equal to double the Navigator's Perception Bonus. In addition, information about such objects is not only what the Navigator could discover through normal observation.\n\nMaster: As above, except the range becomes equal to five times the Navigator's Perception Bonus in days old. In addition, information becomes much more concrete and specific. Should something else occupy the same space as the object (i.e., mineral deposits, void reefs, a starship has been mined out), the Navigator can determine what kind of craft travelled through that zone in space. Whether or not the object is actually within the Navigator's field of vision, he receives exact knowledge when warp-travelling about similar locations.\n\nVOID WATCHER\nUsing this power and gazing into the void whilst aboard a ship, the Navigator can learn things about space in the immediate vicinity of his vessel. This can reveal hidden dangers such as mines, void creatures, concealed ships, and other potential threats lurking invisibly in the black void of space.\n\nNovice: The Navigator can make a Perception Test (modified by range and potential interference as the GM thinks reasonable) to detect objects in space up to a distance equal to the Navigator's Perception Bonus in Void Units (see page 212, Chapter VIII: Starships). During Space Combat, this distance equals 1,000 kilometres times the Navigator's Perception bonus. Information about such objects is only what the Navigator could discover through normal observation.\n\nAdept: Same as above, however, range increases to a distance equal to double the Navigator's Perception Bonus in Void Units (see page 212, Chapter VIII: Starships), or 10,000 kilometres during ship-to-ship combat. The Navigator may take a Half Action to become concentrated and tries the Navigator's Perception Bonus. If the power is used during space combat, the Navigator becomes disoriented. Should he fail three degrees or more during Space Combat, he falls into a Difficult (-10) trance for 1d5 rounds for perceiving where he is. At the end of this duration, should something else occupy the same space as the object (i.e., minerals, a void reef, or a starship), the Navigator knows what kind of space the object is present within, its exact position, and what kind of craft it may be.\n\nMaster: As above, except range becomes equal to five times the Navigator's Perception Bonus in Void Units (see page 212, Chapter VIII: Starships), or 100,000 metres during ship-to-ship combat. For this, however, the Navigator suffers a level of Fatigue each Round when using the power. When not being used during Space Combat, this may be used to triple his Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining Initiative and grant an additional Reaction.\n\nThe Lidless Stare and other powers of the Navigator will have an effect on Adepts of both the Navigators and of others who peer behind the veil. When eye meets eye, the Lidless Stare can be a force capable of rendering the denizens of the Empyrean inactive."

      "text": "THE LIDLESS STARE\nIf a Navigator opens his Warp Eye fully, anyone gazing into its depths will witness the power and mind-breaking unreality of the warp and see the immaterial essence of all things beyond common existence, and for many, it is the last thing they ever see. This is especially effective against creatures with a strong connection to the warp, which can have devastating consequences.\n\nNovice: The Navigator makes an Opposed Willpower Test with anyone looking into his Warp Eye. Make a single Test for the Navigator and compare it to the results of each of his opponents. If the Navigator achieves more degrees of success than the opponent, they suffer 1d10+ the Navigator's Willpower bonus Energy damage.

If they pass, they suffer 1d5 Insanity Points.\n\nGAINING NAVIGATOR MUTATIONS\nWhen a Navigator character is created, he will start play with a number of mutations determined by his lineage (see \"Choosing Your Lineage\" on Page 176 of this chapter). He does not get to choose the specifics of flesh or disfigurement of his form with these mutations, reflecting the fact that these have been with him since birth. Thereafter, whenever the character gains a Navigator Power or increases his level of mastery of an existing power (e.g., going from Adept to Master), the Navigator must test to avoid gaining additional mutations.\n\nTESTING FOR RESISTING MUTATION\nNavigators are bred for resistance to the mutating effects of the Navigator Gene; this will be a factor of a character's resilience and susceptibility, which is determined not only by the physical purity of his gene-stock. When a Navigator gains a power or increases a power, he makes an Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test. If he fails by one or more degrees of failure, then the Navigator manifests a mutation, determined by rolling on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations.\n\nEXAMPLE\nA Navigator's Toughness Bonus is 3. He gains a Navigator Power—Foreshadowing—at the Novice level and must now roll to see if his body begins to mutate further. He makes an Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test, rolling a 47, which is a failure (his Toughness Characteristic is 37, +10 from the test, for a target number of 47). The Navigator now rolls on Table 7-1: Navigator Mutations.\n\nTABLE 7-1: NAVIGATOR MUTATIONS\nRoll | Mutation\n-----|----------\n01-10 | Strangely Jointed Limbs: Your arms have extra joints. Limbs fold and bend in unusual and unnatural fashion. You gain a +10 bonus to the Contortion Skill.\n11-20 | Elongated Form: You stand unusually tall and thin; body proportions permanently twisted. You gain a +10 bonus to the Intimidate Skill.\n21-30 | Inhuman Eyes: Your eyes are dark or perhaps colorless, like a deep shadow. You gain the Dark Sight Trait.\n31-40 | Cerebral Enlargement: Your head bulges outward from your cranium. You gain +5 to your Intelligence Characteristic.\n41-50 | Bloated Form: Your body is grotesquely bloated, and your limbs thick with flesh. You suffer -1 to your Agility Characteristic.\n51-60 | Fleshy Coils: Coils of dark and ductile flesh grow from your body. You gain a +10 to Fellowship Tests when interacting with members of Navigator Houses.\n61-70 | Deadened Flesh: Your body is unnaturally resilient—your skin tough and thick when broken. Your flesh heals unnaturally quickly and bones knit together after being horrifically broken.\n71-80 | Repellent Aspect: Those who see you feel uneasy and find your simple presence threatening. You suffer a -10 to all Fellowship Tests made with people other than members of Navigator Houses.\n81-90 | Overactive Organ Function: Blood rushes more quickly through your veins, and your muscles are more powerful. You gain +5 to your Strength Characteristic.\n91-00 | Double Pupil: Your human eyes feature a strange split pupil that renders the Navigator's gaze unsettling to ordinary humans. You suffer a -5 to all Fellowship Tests made when interacting with anyone who can see your eyes."

      "text": "TIDES OF TIME AND SPACE\nBy examining the flow of the Warp around him, the Navigator can anticipate far future actions and thus move outside the normal flow of events, slipping between the strands of time. To the Navigator, it is also very dangerous and should he lose control, the results can be disastrous.\n\nNovice: Each round the Navigator wishes to use this power, he must make a Challenging (+0) Perception Test. Whether successful or not, the Navigator suffers 1 level of Fatigue. If the test succeeds, he doubles his Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining Initiative and may take an additional Half Action on his turn. The additional Action may only be a Move Action or a Concentration Action. For Extended uses of failing the test, he halves his Agility bonus for the Round and cannot take reactions until making a successful Psychic Test, which brings him back into position.\n\nAdept: As above.\n\nNAVIGATING THE WARP\nThe process of navigating through the Warp is a highly complex calculation before the vessel is guided into the Immaterium. The figure is selected by the Games Master and kept secret from the player, though the Navigator might attempt a general assessment of the duration of passage based upon the Navigator's experience. He the Navigator might be able to tell the player roughly how many game days the journey might take once the Navigator successfully plots his course.\n\nDark Master Darkan Grym of the Sagacious Saint leads a brilliant Navigator who has navigated a ship into the Warp. The Navigator's Estimate will be used to set the succeeding stages of travel.\n\nStage One: Determining Duration of Passage\nStage Two: Location of the Astronomican\nStage Three: Charting the Course\nStage Four: Steering the Vessel\nStage Five: Leaving the Warp\n\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS OF WARP NAVIGATION\nNavigating the warp is the single most complicated task that a Navigator must perform. The following stages are used for determining whether or not a ship arrives at its desired destination safely and in a timely fashion.\n\nStage One: Determining Duration of Passage\nThe subjective time experienced (real time) traveling through the Warp will be determined before the calculation of how much Real Space has been traveled by the vessel. The amount of time (in days) experienced in the Real World whilst a ship remains in the Warp can be determined by following the sample durations under ideal conditions (i.e., a well-maintained ship under experienced officers and a Navigator). Use the Table 7-2: Example Durations of Passage for this time.\n\nTABLE 7-2: EXAMPLE DURATIONS OF PASSAGE\nA simple Journey between close Solar Systems: 1d5 days\nA Journey between neighboring systems: 1d5 weeks\nA lengthy journey between several sectors: 1d10 months\nA journey between Segmentums: 1d5 years\n\nThe Game Master should, however, feel free to vary this rate if circumstances would warrant quicker or longer travel times. Factors such as turbulence in the empyrean, the presence of severe Warp Storms, Nebulae regions in real space, and other strange phenomena can all affect the passage of time for a ship during its journey. Factual accounts of ships that have reached their destinations faster than normal or those that have struck out and found a path to an easier destination exist but they are extremely unlikely.\n\nStage Two: Location of the Astronomican\nOnce the vessel is Translated to the Warp, the Navigator must gauge the strength of the Astronomican and determine its direction. Make an Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test; success means that the Navigator has located the Astronomican and can use it as a point of reference to navigate his voyage. Without the Astronomican, the Navigator can experience significant disorientation and range imprecision when charting a course, especially if he relies upon ancient and inexact charts. The GM may, at his discretion, grant a bonus to this Test if the Navigator has excellent charts (at the GM's discretion). If he fails the Test, the Navigator may not try again (at the GM's discretion) and consequence of this failure could be dire indeed.\n\nStage Three: Charting the Course\nOnce the Navigator has a point of reference and perception determined, he can chart a course through the Immaterium. Make an Ordinary (+10) Perception Test to chart the course; should the Navigator fail this roll, the GM may determine that the ship will be at a risk of avoiding Warp encounters (see page 185).\n\nStage Four: Steering the Vessel\nOnce this is accomplished, the Navigator makes his Navigation roll at the conclusion of his voyage. This Navigation Test takes into account the course set earlier and the Navigator's perception. Make a Navigation (Warp) Test, with difficulty determined by the GM, based on factors such as a well-established warp route, turbulence in the Immaterium, and other factors as presented in Table 7-3: Navigation Chart to see the result of this test.\n\nOff Course\nIf a Navigator fails his Navigation (Warp) Test and rolls a \"19\" or higher (as determined by the GM) for degrees of failure, the vessel will arrive in the Warp \"somewhere\" (as determined by the GM) other than its intended destination.\n\nEncounters in the Warp\nThe Navigator should make a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test (see Table 7-4 on page 185) once for every five full days of travel within the Warp. If a journey takes under five days to complete, one roll for Warp Travel Encounters is still made as often as the GM decides. The GM may decide that the Navigator need not make this Test if the Navigator has previously traveled a route; a +10 bonus for Warp Encounters is applied. However, a roll for Warp encounters is still made to offset the risk of navigating into the Unknown or a perilous region. This peril increases the risk of incidents. To reflect the peril, the Navigator should make a Test on Table 7-4: Warp Travel Encounters (see Page 185) once for every four full days of travel within the Warp."

      "text": "FOR THE GM: DIFFICULTY OF PASSAGE\nGame Masters should determine how difficult the course through the warp's churning tides will be, based on factors such as how far the characters wish to travel and how direct their passage will be. Unusual phenomena, a turbulent region of the Warp, storms and chaotic patterns of the Immaterium, and dark tides across vessels' path can make Navigation Tests more difficult.\n\nIf the Navigator is using an established warp route—counted as a route that has been successfully traversed within the previous month by the Navigator (see Page 146), a passage where the currents of the Immaterium are calm and familiar—then the GM may decide that the Navigator need not make any rolls for Warp Encounters at all. Alternately, if the route is very well-established and the Navigator has previously traveled it, a bonus of +20 to Navigation (Warp) Tests while navigating that specific course is added (the Navigator need not make any rolls for encounters). A route is very well-established if the Navigator succeeded with three degrees or more on his previous Navigation (Warp) Test on the same route.\n\nAssessing Warp Conditions\nSee \"Stage Three: Charting the Course\" for Help.\n\nTABLE 7-3: NAVIGATION CHART\nDegrees of Success | Random Gellar Field Failure | Result\n-------------------|---------------------------|-------\n0 | 1% | Duration Reached: The Games Master's imagination should determine nothing otherwise: the ship safely reaches its destination after the duration set by the GM in Stage One.\n1 | -1% | Duration Reached Faster: The ship reaches its destination safely but also sooner—the entire journey takes 15-20% less time than originally estimated.\n2+ | -2% | Good Star Sailing: The ship reaches its destination in half the time estimated by the GM in Stage One.\n\nDegrees of Failure | Random Gellar Field Failure | Result\n-------------------|---------------------------|-------\n1 | 1% | Duration Lengthened: The journey takes 15-20% longer than originally estimated.\n2 | 2% | Navigation Shorted: The journey takes twice as long as originally estimated.\n3+ | 3% | GM Score: The journey takes as long as the GM wants, depending on the story."

      "text": "GELLAR FIELD FAILURES\nShould dice roll a failure, the Game Master's imagination should determine what befalls the Explorers. They must quickly restore the Gellar Field's integrity before the worst befalls them. To accomplish this, they will still need to pass a Tech-Use Test, though even if they survive, the ship will be full of noxious entities. The GM should feel free to plague them with all manner of daemons, psychic phenomena, mutation, and terrible forms of madness before the players fortunately restore their ship's Gellar Field.\n\nDepending on the situation, rather than attacking the Explorers directly, these entities may prefer to feast upon the Ship's Crew Population as well (see page 224). If the battles become particularly ferocious, or if the GM is feeling particularly cruel to the players, rolling on the Results Table may generate surprising levels of damage to their vessel.\n\nStage Five: Leaving the Warp\nOnce the Navigator's destination is reached, he must place a Fire-beacon, decelerate, and make a Hard (-20) Perception Test to determine the accuracy of Translation space, which is when the vessel emerges from the warp in a precise location. Succeeding in this Test means that the vessel translates from the warp where the Navigator intended, while failure means that the ship exits the Immaterium at a random location (the GM determines where), which can be dangerous. Given that there is no such thing as a completely safe point in the void, if a vessel exits the warp in deep void rather than in a planetary body (a valid fear, for example), with degrees of failure indicating how far from its course the vessel has come.\n\nWarp Travel Encounters\nThis section provides a brief overview of some of the most common hazards that a Navigator might face whilst crossing the void. Perils in the Warp are innumerable, and while these rules provide a game mechanic, the actual means of these connections with the rules for navigating the Warp should inspire the Game Master's creativity and terminal imagination.\n\nTABLE 7-4: WARP TRAVEL ENCOUNTERS\nRoll | Effect\n-----|-------\n01-24 | Activity Erosion: The crew experiences decreasing morale from the extended duration of the trip.\n25-34 | Mutation Flares: Minor mutations and whispers plague the crew—a product of bad luck and careless navigation.\n35-46 | Lost Timing: The flow of time expands, dilates, or contracts, causing strange temporal discontinuities.\n47-56 | Haunting Ghost Ship: A derelict hulk lost in the warp can still haunt other vessels.\n57-63 | Shadows and Portents: The Warp flows around the ship, causing inconsistencies and unreliable observation of the passing madness. The Navigator makes an Unfocused Perception Test with one degree of failure.\n64-70 | Gellar Field Weakness: One weakness in the Gellar Field causes a 1% chance of failure as the device begins to fail and the energy contracting to realspace returns.\n71-80 | Whine of the Warp: The sound of the warp can be heard onshore; every cabin changes to a hideous chittering chorus. Everyone aboard should make a Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points.\n81-89 | Perils in the Warp?: The Navigator must roll on the Perils of the Warp Table for effects within the warp.\n90-100 | Ghost Crew: A ship's encounter with some vast entity of the warp means that every soul within the Warp dies as one.

The command of a warship gives the Lord-Captain the means to accomplish the goals given unto him by his Warrant of Trade. A starship is both his home, his place of commerce, his weapon, and his shield. Small wonder that many a Rogue Trader forms an attachment to his ship. It is both his collection of tech-priests, servitors, and gun crews that maintain command of his starship. It is also the means by which to accomplish his divine mandate. However, a ship is more than just a tool by which the Rogue Trader can maintain his ventures. More powerful than an Imperial Governor, more deadly than a Cardinal of the Ecclesiarchy, a Rogue Trader can wield more power than any other single individual in the machinery of the Imperium. When he unleashes his ship's single broadside, he is summoning more firepower than most PDF armies command; but the tech-priests and the enginseers and the ratings who man the ship's components simply call the vessel home.\n\nLIFE AMONGST THE STARS\nA starship is home to thousands if not tens of thousands of crew men and explorers. At a starship's helm can be the command staff, the Lord-Captain and those whose duty is to serve under him. However, there are also galley-masters, teams of loaders, chirurgeons, and tech-priests, for a void-ship must be self-sufficient. There is also those whose technical expertise and dim machinations are appreciated--engine-workers but internally concealed through the teeming corridors of bilge-settlers and void-born. The priests of the Ministorum are also aboard, whose job it is to keep the souls of the crew free from corruption. Finally, there are Navigators and witchfinders who stand around the Navigator Sanctum (or Steps Cari).\n\nThe warrant of the Rogue Trader provides the Lord-Captain with command of his vessel, resources, and responsibility to accomplish the Emperor's will. Small wonder that the Rogue Trader commands more firepower than a Planetary Governor and more wealth than an Imperial Crusade. The command of his starship is his collection of tech-priests, servitors, and gun crews that equip him with the means to accomplish his divine mandate.\n\nLifeblood flows through a starship. Even the lowest workers and deck-pressers responsible for basic maintenance have encountered worlds that most Imperial citizens only dream of visiting. There are few planets amongst the cold stars that Rogue Trader ships have not visited, and thus menial laborers aboard starships know something of the worlds outside the shipwalls. On the other hand, something of the cold void and ship life inevitably seeps into the crew, who often face condescension or outright contempt, after serving their lives upon a vessel. But they also know something of the weapons batteries, and the future breaches, and have a usefulness that no mere cult would possess.\n\nIt is also unsurprising that after many years aboard a starship, a crewman thus has an island-like mentality, a closed system that resents any intrusion from the outside world. Even to stand upon a planet is alien to void-born; they feel uncomfortable under an unregulated sky, and many find the vast open space of a planetary surface disorienting after the confining corridors and labyrinthian layouts of their vessel.\n\nTHE SOUNDS OF SHIPBOARD LIFE\nTo the uninitiated, the rumbling, muttering, and distant noises of shipboard life can be frightening and alien. Yet those who have spent time aboard vessels come to hear this background noise as quite comforting, similar to the white noise of the planet-bound, whose city sounds and constant operation form a background drone that vanishes into the subconscious. A ship can rarely ever achieve true silence; even during the diurnal cycle, when most of the crew is asleep, the regulated drone of the plasma drives and life support continues, though with additional creaking, booming, and ghastly whispers mixing with the quieter operations. The quiet servitors marking shift changes signal throughout the metallurgical and mechanistic ship, gradually calling for master-privates to ignite void columns and begin the morning."

      "text": "RESULTS TABLE\nIn order to determine the complex scenarios of all the devastating effects of encounters that can go wrong in the Warp, leading to Ghost Ships and more, roll on the table below for additional effects:\n\nRoll | Shipboard Result\n-----|----------------\n01-10 | Hull Breach: Explosions and damage to the ship's hull causes 1 point of Hull Integrity damage and counts as 1 Adverse Environmental Condition for the remainder of the journey.\n11-20 | Crew Psychosis: Minor damage to the Gellar Field causes the crew to suffer acute paranoia, seeing potential enemies in the corners of every shadow. Make a Challenging (+0) Command Test; if the Test fails, the ship's Crew Population decreases by 1 point.\n21-30 | Fire Emergency: Serious system damage aboard the ship causes a shipboard fire that requires an immediate response. Make a Challenging (+0) Command Test to direct your crew to the affected areas and bring the fire under control. If the Test is failed, the ship suffers 1 point of Hull Damage and the fire continues to burn for 1d5 days.\n31-40 | Hull Integrity Damage: Severe shipboard damage leads to extensive hull breaches. The ship suffers 1d5 Hull Integrity Damage.\n41-50 | Catastrophic Power Failure: A ship-wide power failure means that no component works except for the life-sustainer (which operates on reserve power). Make a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. If the Test is failed, the ship stalls in the Warp while the power is restored. During this stall period, the ship automatically suffers an additional encounter from Table 7-4: Warp Travel Encounters.\n51-60 | Emergency Repairs: The ship has been so damaged that immediate repairs are required. Increasing the ship's Tech-Use by +10, make a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test; if this Test is failed, the Tech-Priests remove 1 Component from the ship to keep the vessel operating and avoid a disastrous Warp translation. The Component removed is chosen by the Game Master.\n61-70 | Crew Evacuation: Damage to the ship is severe enough that entire sections must be abandoned. Make a Challenging (+0) Command Test. If the Test is failed, the ship's Crew Population decreases by 2 points.\n71-80 | Sensor Overload: This unusual effect from the Warp sends the ship's sensors into a state of continuous cascade failure for the entire journey. The crew lacks accurate sensory data about the ship's surroundings. Make a Difficult (-10) Command Test; if the Test is successful, the crew copes well. If the Test is failed, the ship may exit the Warp at an unintended location.\n81-90 | Collision: The ship collides with unknown objects as it drifts through the Warp. Make a Difficult (-10) Pilot Test; if the Test is failed, the ship suffers 1d5 Hull Integrity Damage and may exit the Warp at an unintended location.\n91-100 | Catastrophic Damage: The ship suffers a complete systems failure. Make a Very Hard (-30) Tech-Use Test; if the Test is failed, the ship suffers 3d10 Hull Integrity Damage and the Game Master should determine which Components have failed completely.\n\nTHIN SKIN AGAINST THE VOID\nVessels in the 41st Millennium are the product of incomprehensible and precious technology. Ships take decades to build, even by the greatest forge worlds, and some are centuries or even millennia old, dating back to bygone eras when the technology to produce such vessels was more widely available. Therefore, though a Rogue Trader Legion has followers of the Machine God in his or her retinue, many of the starships that a Rogue Trader and players will face may be poorly produced or out of service generations before his dynasty seeks to engage in combat or even peaceful consort with such vessels.\n\nStarship encounters and Space Combat have their own rules that navigate the deadly and unyielding physics of the cold void. These rules are detailed later in this chapter and function differently from those used in personal combat. Before engaging in those rules, there are certain scenarios and complications that are not represented in the normal rules of Space Combat. Some of these complications will be created by the Game Master, such as plasma storms, stellar weather, or the proximity of other ships and celestial objects, and some of these complications are the result of a degradation in the ship's Characteristics and Components. When a ship builds up damage or suffers complications, the Lord-Captain can remedy these in a variety of ways. Most of these involve spending Achievement Points to hire additional crew, secure materials, or even purchase a new ship (see Chapter XIII: Endeavors).\n\nDEROGATION\nOver the course of a starship's travels, the Lord-Captain will inevitably be required to push systems beyond their intended use, modify engines to function despite needed repairs, and cope with inefficient crew members. Whilst the Lord-Captain might periodically manage to inspire the crew to great efforts and cast aside the derogation of ship's systems for brief moments (adrenalin-fueled combat is good for this, or ritual prayer sessions to the Machine God), general wear and tear on the vessel and its crew will compound over time unless the Lord-Captain takes drastic action to restore the ship to its full capacity. Over time, these small inefficiencies accumulate and eventually lead to a negative modifier called derogation. Derogation is a modifier that leaves the ship less efficient and capable."

      "text": "RESULTS TABLE\nIn order to determine the complex scenarios of all the devastating effects of encounters that can go wrong in the Warp, leading to Ghost Ships and more, roll on the table below for additional effects:\n\nRoll | Shipboard Result\n-----|----------------\n01-10 | Hull Breach: Explosions and damage to the ship's hull causes 1 point of Hull Integrity damage and counts as 1 Adverse Environmental Condition for the remainder of the journey.\n11-20 | Crew Psychosis: Minor damage to the Gellar Field causes the crew to suffer acute paranoia, seeing potential enemies in the corners of every shadow. Make a Challenging (+0) Command Test; if the Test fails, the ship's Crew Population decreases by 1 point.\n21-30 | Fire Emergency: Serious system damage aboard the ship causes a shipboard fire that requires an immediate response. Make a Challenging (+0) Command Test to direct your crew to the affected areas and bring the fire under control. If the Test is failed, the ship suffers 1 point of Hull Damage and the fire continues to burn for 1d5 days.\n31-40 | Hull Integrity Damage: Severe shipboard damage leads to extensive hull breaches. The ship suffers 1d5 Hull Integrity Damage.\n41-50 | Catastrophic Power Failure: A ship-wide power failure means that no component works except for the life-sustainer (which operates on reserve power). Make a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. If the Test is failed, the ship stalls in the Warp while the power is restored. During this stall period, the ship automatically suffers an additional encounter from Table 7-4: Warp Travel Encounters.\n51-60 | Emergency Repairs: The ship has been so damaged that immediate repairs are required. Increasing the ship's Tech-Use by +10, make a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test; if this Test is failed, the Tech-Priests remove 1 Component from the ship to keep the vessel operating and avoid a disastrous Warp translation. The Component removed is chosen by the Game Master.\n61-70 | Crew Evacuation: Damage to the ship is severe enough that entire sections must be abandoned. Make a Challenging (+0) Command Test. If the Test is failed, the ship's Crew Population decreases by 2 points.\n71-80 | Sensor Overload: This unusual effect from the Warp sends the ship's sensors into a state of continuous cascade failure for the entire journey. The crew lacks accurate sensory data about the ship's surroundings. Make a Difficult (-10) Command Test; if the Test is successful, the crew copes well. If the Test is failed, the ship may exit the Warp at an unintended location.\n81-90 | Collision: The ship collides with unknown objects as it drifts through the Warp. Make a Difficult (-10) Pilot Test; if the Test is failed, the ship suffers 1d5 Hull Integrity Damage and may exit the Warp at an unintended location.\n91-100 | Catastrophic Damage: The ship suffers a complete systems failure. Make a Very Hard (-30) Tech-Use Test; if the Test is failed, the ship suffers 3d10 Hull Integrity Damage and the Game Master should determine which Components have failed completely.\n\nTHIN SKIN AGAINST THE VOID\nVessels in the 41st Millennium are the product of incomprehensible and precious technology. Ships take decades to build, even by the greatest forge worlds, and some are centuries or even millennia old, dating back to bygone eras when the technology to produce such vessels was more widely available. Therefore, though a Rogue Trader Legion has followers of the Machine God in his or her retinue, many of the starships that a Rogue Trader and players will face may be poorly produced or out of service generations before his dynasty seeks to engage in combat or even peaceful consort with such vessels.\n\nStarship encounters and Space Combat have their own rules that navigate the deadly and unyielding physics of the cold void. These rules are detailed later in this chapter and function differently from those used in personal combat. Before engaging in those rules, there are certain scenarios and complications that are not represented in the normal rules of Space Combat. Some of these complications will be created by the Game Master, such as plasma storms, stellar weather, or the proximity of other ships and celestial objects, and some of these complications are the result of a degradation in the ship's Characteristics and Components. When a ship builds up damage or suffers complications, the Lord-Captain can remedy these in a variety of ways. Most of these involve spending Achievement Points to hire additional crew, secure materials, or even purchase a new ship (see Chapter XIII: Endeavors).\n\nDEROGATION\nOver the course of a starship's travels, the Lord-Captain will inevitably be required to push systems beyond their intended use, modify engines to function despite needed repairs, and cope with inefficient crew members. Whilst the Lord-Captain might periodically manage to inspire the crew to great efforts and cast aside the derogation of ship's systems for brief moments (adrenalin-fueled combat is good for this, or ritual prayer sessions to the Machine God), general wear and tear on the vessel and its crew will compound over time unless the Lord-Captain takes drastic action to restore the ship to its full capacity. Over time, these small inefficiencies accumulate and eventually lead to a negative modifier called derogation. Derogation is a modifier that leaves the ship less efficient and capable."

      "text": "A ship has a number of possible Derogation Points equal to 10. The more Derogation Points a vessel has, the greater its penalty becomes to all Operations. When a ship has 1 Derogation Point, it suffers a -5 to all Operations. When it has 2 Derogation Points, it suffers a -10 penalty to all Operations, and so forth. A starship rarely begins its path into Derogation; more frequently, the inefficiencies compound over time following the action: damage to a ship's Hull Integrity, damage to Crew Population, and damage to Component performance. Derogation mimics the problems encountered by the ships of the Imperium—those that have been poorly serviced over generations of neglect. It is essentially a catch-all category of penalties and challenges that make starships difficult to operate. In game terms, Derogation Points are gained in the following ways:\n\n• Whenever a ship's Hull Integrity is reduced below 50% of its maximum value, add 1 Derogation Point to the ship.\n\n• Whenever a ship's Crew Population is reduced from its maximum value by more than 10 points, add 1 Derogation Point to the ship.\n\n• Traveling through especially dangerous areas (such as a warp storm) or areas where Imperial authority and assistance are thin may add Derogation Points to a ship's score.\n\n• The GM may choose to add 1 or more Derogation Points when a ship is damaged severely in some other fashion.\n\nDerogation can be removed by using Achievement Points to refurbish the ship—see Endeavors on page 281. The Lord-Captain can also attempt special jury-rigging efforts to reduce a ship's Derogation Points as detailed under Repairs on page 228.\n\nADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS\nIn the infinite void of the cosmos, the dangers are beyond reckoning. Aetheric discharges, gravity wells, tectonic fields, solar radiation, plasma storms, micro-meteor strikes, the dense residue of nebulae, and debris fields from ancient starship battles can all have a significant effect on a ship's performance. These phenomena are grouped and called Adverse Environmental Conditions. The Game Master should decide when a ship is traveling within a system or operating in an area that contains Adverse Environmental Conditions. Such conditions can be minor or severe:\n\n• Minor Adverse Environmental Conditions impose a -10 to a ship's Detection and Speed Characteristics.\n\n• Severe Adverse Environmental Conditions impose a -20 to a ship's Detection and Speed Characteristics.\n\n• Devastating Adverse Environmental Conditions impose a -30 to a ship's Detection, Speed, and Manoeuvrability Characteristics.\n\nIf a ship is suffering the effects of the Derogation described above, these penalties are cumulative with the Adverse Environmental Conditions. However, the Game Master may also decide that some ships are better able to handle certain conditions than other ships. Therefore, he may adjust these penalties as he sees fit.\n\nMALFUNCTIONING COMPONENTS\nComponents that are damaged or have become unreliable can cause problems far beyond the immediate issues that they create. For example, a malfunctioning Warp Drive may leak energies into neighboring components and render them useless. This section provides a game mechanic for determining when a Component is so degraded that it's malfunctioning.\n\nIf a Rogue Trader's vessel has more than 3 Derogation Points, the GM should determine which ship Component is malfunctioning by rolling on the following table:\n\nRoll | Component Type\n-----|-----------------\n01-30 | Essential Component\n31-75 | Supplemental Component\n76-00 | Weapon Component\n\nOnce the GM has determined the general category, he should select the specific type of Component. If the selected Component is a weapon, it ceases to function, causing the Component to be unavailable. Once the selected Component is determined to be malfunctioning, a Tech-Use Test is required to determine the nature of the malfunction. Depending on the precise nature of the malfunction, other Components may also be affected. If components adjacent to or in direct line of the malfunctioning Component are damaged, it might even cause a complete system failure (for example, plasma leakage from the engine).\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF MALFUNCTIONING COMPONENTS\nMalfunctioning Components are unavailable until repaired. The Captain can attempt a Repair action to restore a single malfunctioning Component. See the Repairs Action on Page 228. In many cases, a malfunctioning Component will spread its effects to nearby Components, these neighboring Components are also rendered unavailable. Components can only be repaired once per strategic turn."

      "text": "DAMAGE CONTROL\nWhen a ship's component begins to malfunction, the results can be both chaotic and deadly as the ship's carefully balanced systems begin to fail. Once a Component begins to malfunction as described above, the GM makes a Hard (-20) Tech-Use Test. If the Test is successful, the problem is isolated and only affects the Component that is already malfunctioning. However, if this Test is failed, the damage spreads, taking additional neighboring Components offline. The GM should roll on the Table 8-1: Component Spread to see which additional Components are damaged.\n\nTABLE 8-1: COMPONENT SPREAD\nRoll | Result\n-----|-------\n01-30 | 1d5 additional Components malfunction along with the original.\n31-60 | 3 additional Components malfunction along with the original.\n61-75 | 1 additional Component is destroyed in addition to the original malfunctioning Component.\n76-00 | A critical failure within the system renders any Components of this type unusable (i.e., if Macrocannons are malfunctioning, all weapons of this type are unavailable). If there are special narrative reasons that the GM wants to increase or decrease this effect, he should feel free to adjust the results of this table.\n\nREPAIRS\nCorrecting Components requires a Difficult (-10) Tech-Use Test. If the Test is successful, the Component is repaired. If the Test fails, the Component remains disabled (see page 228).\n\nCOMPONENT CARDS\nEach Component in ROGUE TRADER is detailed on pages 202-211 of this chapter. These pages provide a handy reference for what each Component does and the game effects of installing a Component on a ship. In addition, Components have the following information in their descriptions:\n\nSpace: The amount of Space that the Component takes up on a ship.\nPower: The amount of Power drawn from the ship's engines.\nShip Points: The number of Ship Points generated by the Component when used for constructing a vessel.\nMounting: Where the Component can be mounted on a ship (Prow, Keel, Dorsal, etc).\n\nVOID COMBAT\nIn the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium, trading ships routinely mount massive weapon systems and defend themselves from the many xenos threats and piratical raiders that plague the stars. However, ship-to-ship combat is a much slower endeavor than human-scale conflicts. Ships are massive machines, and changing their vectors requires enormous amounts of energy, while the distance between vessels is so vast that missiles and shells can take minutes to cross. Due to the incredible speeds, tremendous inertia, and time-lag effects of attempting to control titanic war vessels over these distances, many a Lord-Captain has been undone by operating on poor intelligence. This section provides the rules for conducting void combat in the game.\n\nVOID UNITS\nVoid Units are a simple measurement used for working out the relative positions and movement of two vessels at combat speeds. At the scale of starship combat, traditional measurements such as kilometres tend to be ineffective and can seem oddly out of place with the overall game system. The Void Unit (abbreviated VU) is used to measure distances between vessels. A Void Unit is equal to roughly 10,000 kilometers (or around 6,000 miles).\n\nCOMBAT OVERVIEW\nThis section provides a brief overview of void combat in ROGUE TRADER. Ship combat proceeds in strategic rounds, each representing a length of time ranging from minutes to hours of maneuvering, firing weapons, and the resulting impact. At this level, ship combat is relatively similar to normal combat; characters take turns to act and can perform a variety of actions in each round. However, unlike normal personal combat, the position of ships in relation to each other can be of critical importance, especially for determining the range and fire arcs of ship weaponry.\n\nSHIP POSITIONS AND MOVEMENT\nTo launch devastating fusilades of macro-cannons at an enemy ship, the Lord-Captain must first maneuver his vessel within range and present the appropriate ship's fire arcs to target the enemy. This section explains several methods for representing the position and movement of ships. Unlike personal combat, in which combatants literally move around a battlefield, ships in space are traveling at tremendous velocities over vast distances. The ships' relative positions are what matter, along with the angles of their weaponry. In void combat, a ship might approach a target, but rather than stopping and moving past it, the ship's momentum and course might take it in a long arc or force it to spend considerable energy to change vectors for an attack run."

      "text": "COMBAT ZONES\nThe most straightforward way to measure the distance between ships is by using Combat Zones. Combat zones are a measurement of distance between ships and provide a simple way of figuring out what ranges ship weaponry can reach. The zones are arranged in concentric rings surrounding each target vessel. The zone also, in part, determines what Actions the attacking ship can perform and perhaps how effective they will be.\n\nCLOSE RANGE\nClose Range is counted as within 1 Void Unit. At this range, ships can engage with almost any weaponry, ram one another, and potentially use boarding actions (assuming Assault Boats or Teleportariums are employed). Ships are considered point blank at half a VU or less.\n\nMEDIUM RANGE\nMedium Range is considered to be between 1-5 Void Units. At this range, most weaponry is effective, but Lance batteries and torpedoes become especially potent. Mega-cannon barrages become more hit-or-miss, as the enemy vessel has more time to attempt evasive maneuvers, especially if it is a smaller, more maneuverable vessel.\n\nLONG RANGE\nLong Range is considered to be between 5-10 Void Units. At this range, combat between vessels is almost exclusively accomplished using Lance batteries and torpedoes. Voss Pattern macrocannons (see page 210) can also function at this distance. This is also the range at which most spacecraft detection and auspex systems operate with peak efficiency. This is often the range at which a savvy vessel's Master would likely decide whether to engage or avoid an enemy vessel.\n\nEXTREME RANGE\nExtreme Range is considered to be between 10-30 Void Units. This is the maximum distance at which Lance batteries can be expected to maintain any sort of coherency. Torpedoes become less effective except against stationary targets, as the enemy vessels have more time to perform evasive maneuvers. Only Detection Tests can be made at this range.\n\nINDETERMINATE RANGE\nProper engagement in void warfare is impossible at this distance, and sensors become increasingly unreliable, though it is still possible to sometimes track a starship's movement by using a variety of frequencies. This is considered anywhere beyond 30 Void Units, though most ships cannot even detect each other beyond 40 or 50 Void Units. Ships in the materium cannot be engaged if they are at Indeterminate Range.\n\nUSING COMBAT ZONES\nEach ship's starting range is determined by the specific scenario being used for void combat. The GM should decide the initial positions. During most encounters, opposing ships will begin at Extreme Range from each other. This will give the Explorers time to decide whether they wish to engage or not. Some scenarios might involve vessels that are already much closer, such as if a pirate vessel has prepared an ambush, or if the Explorers encounter a vessel in distress that requires aid.\n\nShips move through Combat Zones using the All Ahead maneuver or Silent Running. All Ahead moves a vessel towards or away from the enemy vessel based on the result of the Extended Action and the ship's Speed Characteristic. If the ship is within 1 VU of the enemy ship, a successful Maneuver action such as Come to New Heading (see Maneuvers on page 219) will allow the vessel to move around its enemy while staying at that range.\n\nSPACE COMBAT AND FIRE ARCS\nSupplemented by the ranges described above, fire arcs and facing provide the second half of void combat. Every vessel has a facing in Space Combat; the bearing of the vessel also determines which weapons can be brought to bear against targets. The fire arcs of a vessel are divided into Prow, Port, Starboard, Dorsal, Keel, and Aft. These arcs are described on page 202 of this chapter.\n\nUsing fire arcs to determine the facing of enemy ships is simple. At the start of the scenario, the GM determines the facing of each ship. A ship's fire arcs do not move with the ship when it changes facing; rather the fire arcs are always determined by the location of any enemies. When a vessel moves, Maneuvers must be employed to bring the appropriate weapon batteries or torpedoes to bear. The facing of the vessel also determines which weapons can be fired in broadsides.\n\nEach weapon on a ship has one or more fire arcs. The weapon can be used to attack another ship only if that ship is within one of the weapon's fire arcs. When a ship changes facing, the weapon arcs move with it. For instance, a ship facing another ship prow-on has the enemy in its front arc. If the ship then turns to the port, the enemy would be in the starboard facing of the ship. Or, if the ship rotated approximately 90 degrees, the enemy might now be on the port side of the ship (unless the enemy ship also changes heading). A fine pilot can dance his vessel around an enemy capital ship, keeping within the blind spots of his enemy's weapon arcs and denying them a shot while he maintains his attack."

      "text": "STANDARD ACTIONS IN DETAIL\nThe Standard Actions available to ships in void combat are detailed below. Each ship can only perform one Standard Action per Strategic Round, but the action can vary between rounds.\n\nSHOOTING\nThis is the most common action in ship-to-ship combat. When using this action, the ship fires one of its weapon Components (such as macrocannons, lance batteries, or torpedo tubes) at an enemy vessel. The weapon chosen must be able to fire at the target (i.e. the target must be within the firing arc of the weapon) and the target must be within range. For example, if the target is at range 6 VU, the attacker can only use lances and torpedoes against it (most macrocannons only have a range of 3 VU).\n\nTo make a shooting attack, the player chooses which weapon Component to fire, and then makes a Ballistic Skill Test using the weaponry's profile. The difficulty of this Test depends on the range to the target and other modifiers (see below). If successful, the attacker calculates the damage as detailed in each weapon Component's description.\n\nThere are several factors that make a shot more difficult. These are detailed below.\n\nRange: The modifier depends on what type of weaponry is being employed and the range to the target. See Table 8-2: Shooting Modifiers below.\n\nSilent Running: If the target ship is using Silent Running, it gains a bonus to avoid being hit equal to the number of degrees of success it achieved on its Silent Running Test (see page 227).\n\nAdverse Environmental Conditions: If there are Adverse Environmental Conditions such as thick clouds of gas, nebulae, or a particularly cluttered sector of space, these provide negative modifiers to the attacking ship's Ballistic Skill Test. The modifier depends on the severity of the Adverse Environmental Conditions (see page 187).\n\nDerogation: A ship with Derogation Points suffers a -5 penalty to all shooting actions for each Derogation Point (see page 187).\n\nTABLE 8-2: SHOOTING MODIFIERS\nWeaponry | Short Range | Medium Range | Long Range | Extreme Range\n---------|------------|--------------|------------|----------------\nMacrocannons | +10 | +0 | N/A | N/A\nLances | +10 | +0 | -10 | -30\nTorpedoes | +10 | +0 | -10 | -30\n\nThe base ranges for each weapon are given in their descriptions. In general, however:\n• Short Range is between 0-1 VU.\n• Medium Range is between 1-5 VU.\n• Long Range is between 5-10 VU.\n• Extreme Range is between 10-30 VU.\n\nExample: The raiders' cruiser Pox-Angel fires its macrocannon batteries at the players' vessel. The range is 4 VU, which is Medium Range for macrocannons. This makes the BS Test Challenging (+0). The players' vessel is using Silent Running and has achieved 2 degrees of success, so the raiders' BS Test is at -20. The Pox-Angel's pilot makes a BS Test with a Skill of 40 at -20, for a target result of 20. He rolls a 36 and misses.\n\nDETERMINING CRITICAL HITS\nIf a weapon with the Crippling quality scores a critical hit on an enemy vessel, roll on Table 8-3: Critical Hits. Add +10 to the roll if the weapon has Strength 10 or higher, and an additional +10 if the critical hit was achieved with 4 or more degrees of success. The critical hit takes effect immediately, regardless of the enemy vessel's remaining hull integrity.\n\nTABLE 8-3: CRITICAL HITS\nRoll | Critical Hit Effect\n-----|-------------------\n01-10 | Thrusters Damaged: The ship's propulsion systems are damaged. The vessel's Speed is reduced by 1d5 permanently.\n11-20 | Weapon Destroyed: One randomly determined weapon is destroyed.\n21-30 | Fire!: Flame spreads through the ship. For each round until the fire is put out, the ship suffers 1 additional point of Hull Integrity damage as the flames spread.\n31-45 | Component Damaged: The ship has suffered a catastrophic system failure. One Component chosen randomly by the GM ceases functioning.\n46-60 | Shields Collapsed: The ship loses all remaining Void Shield strength. Additionally, the ship's shield generators short out and are rendered inactive for 1d5 Strategic Rounds.\n61-70 | Hull Breach: The ship's superstructure has been compromised. Each attempt to make repairs now has a -10 modifier.\n71-75 | Plasma Drive Damaged: The plasma drive has been compromised. The ship's Speed and Maneuverability are reduced by half.\n76-80 | Bridge Hit: The ship's bridge has been hit, killing officers and damaging control systems. The ship's Detection and Manoeuvrability are reduced by half. If the ship has a bridge, there is a 50% chance that a key NPC aboard the enemy vessel has been killed.\n81-90 | Warp Drive Damaged: The ship's Warp Drive is fused and the ship cannot travel through the Warp. Additionally, the ship suffers 1 Hull Integrity damage from radiation poisoning.\n91-00 | Catastrophic Damage: The ship's plasma drive detonates or the warp core implodes. In either case, the ship is blown apart, killing the entire crew instantly."

      "text": "LAUNCH CRAFT\nMany capital ships carry smaller vessels, such as attack craft (including bombers and interceptors), assault boats, or other shuttles. These craft are used to accomplish a variety of tasks, from attacking enemy vessels to transporting away teams or boarding parties.\n\nUsing this action, the vessel can deploy craft that it is carrying or recover craft that have been previously deployed. The number of craft that can be deployed or recovered in a single action depends on the size of the carrying vessel. A transport can deploy or recover 1 squadron per Strategic Round. A raider can deploy or recover 1 squadron per Strategic Round. A frigate can deploy or recover 1 squadron per Strategic Round. A light cruiser can deploy or recover 2 squadrons per Strategic Round. A cruiser can deploy or recover 3 squadrons per Strategic Round.\n\nOnce deployed, attack craft act during the same Initiative as the ship that carried them, as they are guided by officers on the carrier. Attack craft can either attack enemy vessels or defend friendly vessels from attack craft. Shuttles and other non-combat craft can be deployed to move cargo to or from the carrying ship. When recovering craft, all craft to be recovered must be within 1 VU of the carrying vessel.\n\nDeploying Attack Craft\nAttack craft are usually deployed in attack squadrons. Each individual squadron has its own profiled attack values. Most vessels that carry attack craft have several squadrons (usually 1d5 per hangar bay) that can be deployed. When a ship launches attack craft, it can direct them toward a target vessel within 1 VU of the carrier. The attack craft immediately engage the target vessel, making an attack (see Attack Craft Vs. Ships on page 221).\n\nAttack Craft Vs. Ships\nWhen attack craft attack an enemy ship, the player controlling the attack craft makes a single attack for the squadron. The attack is resolved with a BS Test, using the BS of the carrier's commander. This attack has a +10 bonus because the attack craft are at extremely close range to the enemy vessel. The target's Turret Rating reduces this bonus as detailed under Attack Craft Vs. Attack Craft on page 221. If the attack is successful, the attack craft inflict damage as detailed in their Component profile.\n\nAttack Craft Vs. Attack Craft\nAttack craft are much smaller vessels than the ships they are launched from, and are correspondingly much more agile and difficult to hit with a conventional ship's guns. However, they are vulnerable to other attack craft and dedicated turrets. When attack craft are targeted by other attack craft (for example, bombers being intercepted by fighters), the attack is resolved normally as per Attack Craft Vs. Ships above. Specialist interceptors are significantly better at engaging other attack craft than bombers (which are configured for attacking capital ships), and thus have a +10 bonus when attacking other attack craft.\n\nA ship can use its turrets to defend against attack craft. Turrets are not normally Components in their own right, but are created by devoting a certain percentage of the ship's mass to gun batteries for point defence. These gun batteries are represented by the vessel's Turret Rating—the higher the rating, the better the vessel is at defeating incoming attack craft. When a ship with turrets encounters attack craft, the turrets automatically engage the attack craft in the ship's defence. For each point of the ship's Turret Rating, the attack craft suffer a -10 penalty to the BS Test to attack the ship. Thus, a ship with a Turret Rating of 2 imposes a -20 penalty on attack craft trying to attack it.\n\nBOARDERS\nShips in the 41st Millennium can engage in boarding actions, where crack teams of armsmen and assault troops board an opponent's vessel with the intention of capturing it or killing its command staff. To attempt this action, the ship must be within 1 VU of the target ship and the two vessels must be on roughly the same trajectory. Additionally, the boarding ship must have one of the following special components to launch a boarding action: Assault Boats or Teleportarium.\n\nASSAULT BOATS\nWhen launching a boarding action with assault boats, the player makes a Challenging (+0) Command Test. If successful, the assault boats convey the boarding parties to the target vessel. Armed with fusion cutters, melta-bombs, and other sealing devices, armsmen attempt to gain entrance. If the carrying ship has a Turret Rating of 2 or higher, half (rounded up) of the boarding party fails to reach the target vessel.\n\nTELEPORTARIUM\nWhen a Teleportarium is used for boarding, the player makes a challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. If the Test is failed, most of the teleporters fail to activate and few troops reach the target ship (the boarding action proceeds as normal but with a -20 penalty). If the Test is failed by three or more degrees of failure, then the teleporters malfunction horribly and the boarding party is scattered into the void or rematerialises inside the ship's bulkheads, killing them instantly. In these cases, the boarding action automatically fails and no boarding parties arrive on the target ship."

      "text": "BOARDING PARTIES\nOnce the boarding parties arrive on the target, they attempt to seize control of the target vessel. To represent this, the boarding player makes a Command Test opposed by the target ship's commander. The following modifiers apply to this Test:\n\n• The boarding vessel receives a +10 bonus if it has Space Marines or other elite warriors as part of its boarding party.\n\n• The boarding vessel suffers a -10 penalty if the target vessel has a Crew Population 20 or higher.\n\n• The boarding vessel suffers a -20 penalty if the target vessel has a Crew Population of 30 or higher.\n\n• If the target vessel is expecting the boarding action (for example, if it has already been boarded by the same vessel within the last few Strategic Rounds), the defender gains a +10 bonus.\n\n• The boarding vessel gains a +10 bonus if it has twice as many more troops as the defending vessel.\n\n• The boarding vessel suffers a -10 penalty if it has half or less the troops of the defending vessel.\n\nBoth sides roll and compare the results. The side with the most Degrees of Success wins the Opposed Test.\n\nIf the defender wins, the boarding party is repulsed and ejected from the ship, but may try again in a later Strategic Round. If the attacker wins, then the effects depend on the number of degrees of success shown below:\n\n1 Degree of Success: The boarding parties secure a foothold on the enemy vessel and can attack again in a subsequent Strategic Round. If they do so, they gain a +10 bonus to the Command Test and the defender suffers a -10 penalty.\n\n2 Degrees of Success: As above, and the boarding parties begin to gain control of the ship's systems. The target ship suffers a -10 to all Tests involving ship handling, shooting, navigation, etc. This penalty is ongoing as long as the boarders remain on the vessel.\n\n3 Degrees of Success: As above, but the penalty to the target ship's actions is -20.\n\n4+ Degrees of Success: The boarding parties seize control of the vessel. Unless the vessel has secondary command posts and the defending player can justify a last-ditch resistance with key characters, the ship is taken, and the victor can claim it as a prize. If there are NPC vessels, this is at the GM's discretion, based on the narrative and campaign structure.\n\nRAM\nWhen two vessels are within 0.5 VU, one ship can attempt to ram another. This represent the ship colliding with the other vessel at high velocity. It is rarely a winning move, but can be an act of desperation when all else has failed.\n\nTo attempt a ram, the ship must have enough room to accelerate. This requires at least 0.5 VU of room. If the vessel has already slowed to approach its target, it may not have room to build up enough momentum for a ram, and the action will fail.\n\nTo ram, the pilot makes a Challenging (+0) Pilot + Maneuverability Test. If successful, the damage inflicted depends on the size of the two vessels. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d5 Hull Integrity Damage multiplied by the ramming ship's Hull Integrity Bonus (unmodified by damage). However, for each point of Hull Integrity Damage the rammed ship takes, the ramming ship receives one point of Hull Integrity Damage. If both ships survive the attack, they become entangled and neither can move away from the other (this is relevant for weapon arcs and boarding actions). Ships can be eventually disengaged with a successful Come to New Heading Extended Action.\n\nBRACE FOR IMPACT\nA ship can brace itself for incoming attacks. Only NPC vessels normally use this action, as it is primarily intended to prolong fights between non-player ships. However, player vessels can use this action if they so choose. When a vessel uses Brace for Impact, it reduces the damage from all attacks against it by half, and its Void Shield refresh rate doubles."

      "text": "EXTERMINATE\nWhen a ship has been boarded and is fighting to regain control of essential areas, the captain can order ship security forces to retake those areas. This is represented by the Exterminate action. When a ship uses this action, the player makes a Command Test opposed by the boarders. The same modifiers apply as for the original boarding action (see page 220). If the defender wins, some effect of the boarding is negated. One degree of success removes the initiative bonus the boarders would gain for a subsequent boarding attempt. Two degrees of success removes the Command penalties imposed by the boarders. Three degrees of success forces the boarders out of the sections of the ship they've seized, returning them to the point where they've merely secured a foothold. Four or more degrees of success eject the boarders from the ship entirely.\n\nLOCK ON\nBefore a vessel can fire its torpedoes, it must first get a firing solution. This requires a Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test. If the Test is successful, the torpedo tubes can be fired at any time later in the Strategic Round (or in a subsequent round at the vessel's normal Initiative) or as a Reaction against an enemy ship during its turn. If a ship Locks On as a Standard Action, it gains a +20 bonus to the Ballistic Skill Test when it actually fires the torpedoes.\n\nBEGIN REPAIRS\nWhen a vessel suffers damage, it can send damage control parties to begin repairs. To repair a ship, the player makes a Tech-Use Test, with a +10 bonus. If successful, the ship regains 1 point of Hull Integrity Damage. The player can also select one damaged component to repair or restore to function. Destroyed Components cannot be repaired in this fashion (they are too badly damaged and require the services of a shipyard).\n\nSPECIAL ORDERS\nRather than taking one of the other Standard Actions, the captain can issue special orders to the crew. When a ship takes this action, the player nominates one of the following effects:\n\n• The ship refreshes its void shields. All shields that have been knocked down since the ship's last turn are restored.\n\n• The ship puts out any fires aboard.\n\n• The ship vents poisonous fumes, smoke, or radiation into space. Any Conditions or Environmental Effects affecting the crew are reduced by one level of severity.\n\n• The ship transfers power to engines. The vessel gains a +10 bonus to all movement-related Tests until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n• The captain delivers an inspiring speech to the crew. The crew ignores all morale-related penalties until the beginning of the ship's next turn.\n\nEXTENDED ACTIONS IN DETAIL\n\nALL AHEAD FULL\nA ship using this Extended Action moves towards or away from a target. Movement in void combat is measured in Void Units (1 VU = 10,000 km, see page 212). For each degree of success, the ship moves 1 VU in the direction of the player's choosing (note that the ship always moves at least 1 VU when this action is attempted, even if no degrees of success are scored). Additionally, for each degree of success the player can choose one of the following effects:\n\n• Roll an additional 1d10 and add the result to determine the ship's Initiative in the next Strategic Round.\n\n• After moving, immediately turn the vessel to present a particular fire arc to the target (bow, port, starboard, etc.). This simulates the ship turning as part of its overall vector.\n\n• Extend or reduce the range between two vessels by 1 additional VU.\n\nCOME TO NEW HEADING\nThis is a maneuver that allows a ship to move laterally rather than directly towards or away from an opponent. A successful Come to New Heading action allows a ship to swing around its opponent while remaining at roughly the same distance. This is often used to bring different weapon batteries to bear or to line up a torpedo shot. For each degree of success on the Test, the player can choose one of the following effects:\n\n• Present a particular fire arc to the target (bow, port, starboard, etc.).\n\n• Change the relative position of the vessel by 45 degrees to the target, while remaining at the same range.\n\n• End the Strategic Round in a position to attempt a Disengage extended action on the vessel's next turn.\n\n• If the vessel is 0.5 VU away from its target, the vessel can position itself for a ram in the next Strategic Round."

      "text": "EMERGENCY REPAIRS\nThis action represents engineering teams and other specialists making quick repairs to damaged systems. Like the Begin Repairs action, this restores Hull Integrity and can return damaged Components to operation. However, because it is an Extended Action, this repair action is much more thorough. For each degree of success, the player can choose one of the following effects:\n\n• Restore 1 point of Hull Integrity.\n\n• Restore 1 point of Crew Population.\n\n• Repair a randomly damaged Component.\n\n• Reduce the ship's Derogation points by 1 (to a minimum of zero).\n\nNote that this action never allows for the repair of destroyed Components.\n\nSILENT RUNNING\nWhen a ship goes to Silent Running, it is powering down active sensor equipment and shutting down most of its energy emissions. This has numerous benefits, but may result in the ship being unable to detect approaching vessels itself. For each degree of success, the ship gains increased concealment. This increases the difficulty for enemy ships trying to detect it (see Detection Tests, below) and also reduces enemy accuracy if they try to fire upon the vessel. For each degree of success, enemy ships suffer a -10 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests to hit the vessel and to Detection Tests to locate the ship.\n\nAlso, for each degree of success, the player can choose one of the following effects:\n\n• The ship becomes completely hidden from all enemy sensors (the enemy may still know roughly where the ship is, but they do not have an accurate fix).\n\n• The ship slips away from the combat entirely (if on the edge of a combat area).\n\n• The vessel achieves an optimal position to launch a counter-attack, gaining a +20 bonus to any Ballistic Skill Test made in the next Strategic Round.\n\nPREPARE TO DISENGAGE\nThis Extended Action allows a ship to leave the battle. To do so, the ship must be at the edge of the battle area or at least away from most hostile vessels. When the ship has accumulated five degrees of success, it has disengaged from the combat.\n\nDETECTION TESTS AND AUSPEX USE\nThe ships of the 41st Millennium use a variety of different sensor technologies to detect other vessels in the void. These include standard electromagnetic scanners and radar, but also thermal imaging and the tech-mystical devices of the Adeptus Mechanicus.\n\nA Detection Test is a Tech-Use Test made on behalf of the ship's sensor operators. Usually this is the duty of the ship's sensorium officer. A successful Test allows the vessel to isolate a ship, debris, or other object in space and determine its exact range, speed, mass, and other essential details. A ship can even make a Detection Test to determine the origin of transmissions or telepathic signals.\n\nThe difficulty of a Detection Test is determined by the distance to the target. At Extreme Range, the Test is Very Hard (-30), at Long Range it is Hard (-20), at Medium Range it is Difficult (-10), and at Short Range it is Challenging (+0). In addition, a vessel that is using Silent Running can be more difficult to detect (see Silent Running on page 227).\n\nDETECTION AND SURPRISE\nWhen a ship attempts to ambush another vessel, the element of surprise is critical. The ambushing vessel makes a Detection Test opposed by the target's own Detection Test. The ambushing vessel gains a +20 bonus to this Test. If the ambusher scores more degrees of success than the target, the target vessel is surprised. A surprised vessel cannot act during the first Strategic Round of an engagement, and may have other restrictions (such as having its void shields powered down) at the GM's discretion.\n\nDETECTING HIDDEN VESSELS\nVessels can use Silent Running to help conceal their presence. They may also enter asteroid fields, nebulae, or other areas with significant interference to normal sensors. A vessel using sensors to detect such hidden ships must make a successful Detection Test. The difficulty of this Test depends on any modifiers from the Silent Running vessel (see page 227) and the range (see Detection Tests and Auspex Use above). If the hidden ship is in an area that provides natural concealment (such as an asteroid field), the Detection Test takes an additional -20 penalty.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nCommunications between vessels take place at the speed of light. This means that there is a slight delay in communications. The delay is one Strategic Round per VU of distance between the vessels, assuming the vessels are using standard electromagnetic communications rather than telepathic relays (which are usually instantaneous, unless blocked by enemy Navigators or rival Astropaths).\n\nIn game terms, this means that vessels that separate can find it increasingly difficult to act as a coherent unit. For RPG purposes, this also means that player characters on different ships can find communication between them becoming increasingly difficult at long range, especially if the vessels do not have Astropaths aboard or the Astropaths are occupied with more pressing duties (such as aiding in combat or coordinating with other vessels in a fleet)."

      "text": "CONSTRUCTING A STARSHIP\nStarship construction is a multi-step process that requires careful consideration of Space and Power requirements. The total Space used by all Components cannot exceed the Space provided by the hull. Likewise, the total Power required by all Components cannot exceed the Power generated by the drive and other Components. Constructed vessels require a minimum Hull Integrity, Crew Population, and Detection values to function effectively.\n\nWhen constructing a vessel, follow these steps:\n\n1) Choose Hull: This will determine the ship's base Characteristics (Speed, Maneuverability, Detection, Hull Integrity) and the amount of Space available for Components.\n\n2) Add Essential Components: Every ship must have one (no more) Component from each of the following categories: Plasma Drive, Gellar Field, Warp Engine, Void Shields, Ship's Bridge, Life Sustainer, Crew Quarters, and Auger Array.\n\n3) Add Supplemental Components: After the Essential Components are installed, players may select Supplemental Components. Each Component has Space and Power requirements that must be tracked.\n\n4) Review Characteristics: The ship's Crew Population is calculated at 100. This generates enough crew members for ships of various sizes; transport, raider, frigate, light cruiser, and cruiser. If a ship's Crew Population is damaged, players have options to increase beyond these maximums, but not by more than 10 points. Complications can arise from gaining Warrant of Trade, the amount of power, or how many voids aboard the ship. When constructing a vessel, these totals may be slightly more resilient. However, ship's Crew Population must also be considered.\n\nEXAMPLE OF SHIP CREW RATING (See Page 214):\nGood Crew (30): The ship is crewed with highly trained and motivated personnel.\nAverage Crew (20): The ship is crewed with a normal mix of decently efficient crew.\nPoor Crew (10): The ship is crewed with self-serving or incompetently led ratings.\nCrack Crew (40): The players can upgrade their Average Crew (20) by spending 5 Achievement Points for their existing Ship Points. They might then upgrade from Good Crew (30) to Crack Crew (40) by spending 5 more Achievement Points.\n\nHULLS\nThe hull of the vessel determines what kind of ship it is. The hull is not a Component that can be added to it. The hull is the base upon which all Components from each of the Essential Component categories can be attached. The hull determines the base Characteristics of the ship (though they may be modified later by supplemental components)."

All voidships might have thousands of Spirit Oddities, quirks, and personality traits. The Emperor's Bounty is strange, with a personality that has developed over the millennia while the crews have watched the stars come and go, wars fought, and deals made. Anyone who has been aboard ships for years knows that ships have desires and personalities, some more willingly than others. Due to this, starships are more than a collection of tech-priests; they are actual entities with machine spirits.\n\nThe Game Master should roll or determine which Complications his ship possesses. These Complications have benefits and drawbacks, both.\n\nTABLE 8-1: MACHINE SPIRIT ODDITIES\n01-10 | Whining: This ship quivers and shakes. Noisy clanking from the engines for no apparent reason normally leads to targeting arrays shorting out and unexpectedly failing. Reduce Detection by -5.\n11-20 | Easily Startled: The ship's Machine Spirit is easily spooked. It communicates emphatically with the bridge. Captains find this ship easier through the warp than other. +10 to all Navigation (Warp) Tests.\n21-30 | Machine Ghost: This ship is haunted by phantoms of servitors who died long ago serving aboard it. The ship's auspex occasionally registers false echoes. When making an Exploration objective test, roll twice and select best.\n31-40 | Recalcitrant: The ship refuses to acknowledge voidsmen's authority.

When determining the effects of a Critical Hit, a randomly selected Component fails unpowered until repaired. However, there is only a 1% chance each day that this will occur.\n51-60 | Machine Whispers: The sound of chanting or whispered litanies can be heard throughout the ship. The Gellar Field draws power from these whispers. Reduce Insanity Points gained when exposed to the Warp by 1d5.\n61-70 | Brave: This ship cannot be cowed; its machine spirit is vibrant and confident, bucking into battle without hesitation when fired upon. However, it is not in danger of running itself. It receives +10 to Command Tests during void combat, but -10 to Navigate (Warp) Tests.\n71-80 | Turbulent: The ship's machine spirit frequently seethes with anger. When in battle, the ship's plasma drives explode into accelerated manoeuvring patterns. +5 to Speed and Manouvrability.\n81-90 | Resolute: The ship cannot surrender. Whatever the circumstances, the ship will not break down or falter. The ship's Hull Points and systems repair themselves at double the normal rate (decreasing the time required for Repairs).\n91-00 | Loyal: This ship has served the Imperium for generations and dates back to when standard velocities were half of today's vessels.

      "text": "THE SHIP AS CHARACTER\nComplications are designed to personalize a starship as well as make it something more than just a collection of statistics and traits. Just as a good captain thinks of his ship as something alive and responding with a personality that offers loyalty or disdain, the GM should make the player characters' starship more memorable and flavorful. If the GM wishes the player's starship to be more interesting, he should select two or three Complications rather than having his players roll. Additionally, the Past Histories include plot hooks and the players themselves may be able to add aspects to their ship to help bring it into focus. For the ship's 'personality,' the Machine Spirit Oddities should be used as general guidelines. GMs should not feel obligated to use the benefits and drawbacks listed on the charts and are encouraged to come up with their own that fit the ship.\n\nFor example, a ship that has Easily Startled occasionally seems nearby vessels, searching to determine if they are friendly (or a ship that is Ancient and Wise finds new dangers, relaying them to the helmsman warning him of danger he did not notice). Of course, the ship is not sentient, and will not strike up conversations with the crew, but its systems can still seem to have more machine personality than would be expected.\n\nESSENTIAL COMPONENTS\nEvery Component presents Mechanica Rituals, power consumption, and availability.

      "text": "STARSHIP COMBAT\nSurprise is critical in void combat. One can ambush another in combat. Since Strategic Rounds last a half-hour, it is highly unlikely that a defender will completely wake the fleet in the first few minutes. How could the defender's crew struggle to prepare their ship for combat when experiencing the effect of surprise? The enemy's first massed reactor surge or salvo of torpedoes crashes through the void shields before they can be brought fully online. Their engines consume energy and explode with the fury of nuclear fire while the vessel's strongest armor plating buckles as thousands of macro-cannon rounds are unleashed in devastating fusillades into the ship.\n\nINITIATIVE\nAt the beginning of the combat, each ship rolls 1d10 and adds its ship's Detection bonus (second digit in the score). Whoever has the higher score will act first during that Strategic Round. If the Rogue Trader has Detection score of 35, they would add a +5 Initiative Bonus to the roll. The precise details of Initiative in structured command combat rounds are extensive. After all, they are not the only ones who desire space for themselves. Rogue Traders must be prepared for battle when travelling the void combat (see page 236).\n\nROUNDS, TURNS, AND TIME IN SPACE\nStarting with the ship with the highest Initiative roll, each ship takes a Strategic Turn, which is handled like a normal combat turn. Space combat is divided into Strategic Rounds. However, unlike normal combat handled in Structured Time rounds, Space warfare is different from the close-in fighting of personal combat and ranged firefights, where combatants tend to engage and disengage more rapidly. Therefore, the GM can break up Space Combat into Strategic Rounds and Strategic Turns.\n\nEach Strategic Round lasts for roughly thirty minutes of in-game time. In each Strategic Round, each ship receives one Strategic Turn. Like regular combat, each ship can perform Actions during their Turn. The Actions a ship performs fall into two categories based upon what they represent in-game. One category of Actions requires more time to execute and encompasses longer tasks, so each ship gets to perform one Standard Action (see page 217) during their Strategic Turn. Each ship can also perform Extended Actions (see page 225), which represent characters doing other activities to help avoid enemy fire.\n\nAfter selecting which Standard Action and Extended Actions the players will perform, and in which order they will be performed when the ship's Turn arrives, they follow certain steps. These steps are similar to those followed in personal combat, the differences noted below.\n\nAfter selecting Actions, the characters who will be working to help the ship succeed must make their Skill Tests, typically adding their ship's Maneuverability to the character's Skill such as Pilot (Space Craft). They then test using this combined value (see page 219).\n\nACTIONS\nEach Strategic Round, every ship receives one Strategic Turn. While the situation is mechanically the same as a Turn in Structured Time combat, each ship can perform its actions in the Round. At the beginning of the ship's Turn, the players (or the GM, if it is an NPC's ship) must announce which Standard Action the ship will be taking this turn. The captain of the ship chooses which Action the ship performs. The players will then select any Extended Actions they want their characters to perform during this Strategic Round."

      "text": "REPRESENTING COMBAT CONCRETELY OR ABSTRACTLY\nSpace Combat works under either concrete or abstraction when describing warfare between spaceships. This was done to keep the rules relatively simple, after all this is a roleplaying game, not exclusively push-to-tip combat. The rules are written so that players may use a standard grid or roleplaying Tactical map while playing ship combats. This makes it easier for the GM and characters to understand the relative position of all the combatants. Many GMs prefer to use a hex grid or miniatures game setup, occasionally the GM can sketch out asteroid belts, planets, and celestial phenomena.\n\nThe simplest way to figure out where combatants are is to use Void Units of distance. Tokens or figures can represent ships, with a line or other form indicating which edge of the token represents the prow of the ship. Alternatively, GMs can operate in a more narrative manner and run a simple system of combat that is more cinematic, like space chess or a miniature edition of the old naval games evolved over centuries.\n\nFor example, the GM might announce that there is a ship coming in nearby, not moving especially quick. To escape, the players' ship makes a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. The players make the roll, and the GM determines that they get close enough to fire without a penalty.\n\nSURPRISE\nSurprise works the same in the first Strategic Round of space combat as in regular combat. The GM must ultimately determine which of the vessels were surprised within the combat situation. Consider if one of the antagonists was hidden (perhaps within an asteroid field), using Silent Running to mask his engine signatures. Alternatively, ships such as raiders or pirates might lie in wait while their opponents fly right past them. Sometimes dangerous weather phenomena or celestial conditions may mask the danger from enemy sensors. Such situations are highly advantageous. The ambusher is certainly in the superior position.\n\nThough silent running and improved sensors may allow a talented operator to detect other vessels, space is vast. Millions of cubic kilometers may need to be searched to detect potential enemies. In addition, the void is a fickle, deviant, and easily fooled by natural phenomena such as radiation, unpredictable gravity fluctuations. The presence of a potential enemy using active shielding and detection devices doesn't necessarily rule out surprise.\n\nAt the beginning of combat, if anyone is surprised, enemy vessels may make a free attack on them during the first Round of combat.\n\nMANOEUVRE ACTIONS\nWhen ships are in void combat (or even in areas of potential combat), opposing ships can determine the direction each starship is facing. A starship's facing matters when determining which direction it will move next and which weapon banks can be brought to bear. The latter matter is usually handled by the starship Weapon Components (see page 235).\n\nWhen a ship takes a Manoeuvre Action, it can move a number of Void Units (VU) up to its Speed value. This is the default. Also as a free action during the Strategic Round, the ship can turn to face any direction. But ships have the option of simply not moving their ship. Once the ship moves forward by its speed value, turning or creating barriers to interaction between starships becomes possible.\n\nA few guidelines: First, one VU represents 10,000 kilometers in distance. Second, starships within one VU are close enough to port or starboard that they may attempt a boarding action if they so choose. Third, all other facts regarding starship movement should be handled narratively between the players and the GM. These full-speed movements (adjusted by a starship's full Speed value) require only a single Pilot Test."

      "text": "Before turning a corner or making a complete maneuver, a ship must move at least half its full Speed value. It is entirely possible that the players perform more Actions than there are characters aboard. In this case, the GM should remember that the NPC crewmembers commanded by the players' characters can perform actions as well. If they don't have enough player characters to perform all actions they desire, the GM will roll to see if the Action is successful.\n\nNPC ACTIONS\nThe GM should decide that the NPC crews performs those Actions not undertaken by the player characters. In general, the NPC crew's Skill rating for performing Actions is equal to the relevant NPC crew's Skill rating. So, if an NPC crewmember needs to perform the Fire Control Action, the GM should consult Table 8-9 (NPC Crew Ratings and Characteristics).\n\nAdjust Speed\nThis Manoeuvre adjusts distance between vessels. If a ship decides to use more than half its Speed Value, then the helmsman makes a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. For every degree of success, the number of VUs his ship moves is one. For every degree of success, the player can choose a number of additional effects (to a maximum of one effect per degree of success). This Manoeuvre can only use the ship's full Speed value.\n\nMoving More Slowly\nIf a starship wants to move more slowly than its normal Speed Value, it can move less than the full Speed Value without a Test. This represents flying at a more careful pace.\n\nMoving More Quickly\nFirst, the ship decides if it is moving at half Speed Value or Full Speed. Then, the helmsman makes a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. For every degree of success, the number of VUs his ship moves is one. For any Speed Value achieved less than half of the ship's Speed Value, the ship can turn without a Test. If the ship moves more than half its Speed Value, then the helmsman must take a separate Hard (-20) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. For every degree of success, the number of VUs his ship moves is one. The ship cannot move more than twice its Speed Value. However, if the vessel has already moved its full Speed value, the ship suffers a -10 to all Ballistic Skill Tests and Pilot Tests.\n\nLikewise, any degree of success awards the benefits of Adjust Speed. All other Manoeuvre Action benefits apply (see Table 8-10).\n\nAdjust Heading\nIf a starship needs to come about before it can turn, First, the ship decides if it is moving at half Speed value or Full Speed. Then, the helmsman makes a Difficult (-10) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. For every degree of success, the number of changes in heading may occur after the starship has moved its full Speed value. The ship suffers normal modifiers for this Manoeuvre. Each degree of success allows the ship to make one partial turn after it has moved its full Speed value. Then turn again after it has moved its full Speed value. The ship suffers normal modifiers for this Manoeuvre."

      "text": "RAMMING AND BOARDING ACTIONS\nThese specific times in the fury of space combat when a captain may order one course of action to save the starship from enemies. If a starship ends a Manoeuvre Action within 0.5 VU of an enemy vessel and its bow is directed towards the target, the starship may make a Shooting Action this turn. The helmsman makes a Hard (-20) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. If he succeeds, the ship crashes into the enemy vessel. The ship rolls 1d10 plus the attacker's Hull Size plus the die roll to determine the total damage inflicted. This damage ignores void shields. The ramming ship in turn takes damage equal to the defending ship's Armour plus 1d5, also ignoring void shields.\n\nDocking to board: Alternatively, if a ship chooses to come to a halt close to an enemy vessel, it can send across parties of armsmen and ratings to take their ship. A ship using a Manoeuvre Action while within 1 VU of its target may give up its optional Shooting Action to board the enemy. The helmsman must make a Hard (-20) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. If he succeeds, the two ships are connected and the boarding action begins. During a boarding action, neither of the ships can take Manoeuvre or Shooting Actions (meaning the two ships remain stationary), although individual characters may initiate Extended Actions. The ships are locked together, and the only way a ship can break free is by making a Hard (-20) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. As soon as the boarding action succeeds, both ships separate, though this may take several Strategic Rounds.\n\nWhen a boarding starts, two characters (one from each ship (whoever is leading the ship or Marines)) make an opposed Command Test. The ship with the higher Crew Population value will receive a +10 bonus to the character making the test. This bonus increases by +10 for every 10 points of difference in Crew Population between the two ships. The ship with higher remaining Hull Integrity provides a +10 bonus to the captain making the Command Test as well (representing a ship without as many hull breaches). Each ship's turret rating also provides a bonus (see page 220).\n\nFor each degree of success the winner may choose one of the following options to his opponent. The loser either suffers 1d5 Crew Population and 1d5 Morale damage (representing the crew cutting through the enemy) or 1 Hull Integrity damage (if possible). Damage to Hull Integrity will also result in Crew Population and Morale damage as normal (see page 222).\n\nAfter the opposed commander Test, both sides roll against their own Morale. If they roll an equal or better number than their Morale, their crew continues to fight. During the next Strategic Turn both ships will make opposed Command Tests again. However, if the opposing ship's captain rolls lower than his current Morale, his crew may surrender to their captors. If the ship is an NPC vessel, it surrenders. If it contains player characters from another ship, they may attempt to flee with a Challenging (+0) Detection + Scrutiny Test from anyone within 20 VUs. Provided their number of degrees of success exceeds those of the pursuer (see below), they escape.\n\nSHOOTING ACTIONS\nAfter completing a Manoeuvre Action, a ship has the option of firing upon an enemy ship. Each Weapon Component may be fired once per Strategic Turn, and each Weapon Component must be fired at the same time, although they may be fired at different targets of the ship's captain's choice. When a ship is disengaged from combat, all Weapon Components must be fired at the same opponents unless the GM specifically states otherwise."

      "text": "STERN CHASE\nA stern chase occurs when ships try to flee from opponents rather than stand and fight. Space is vast and unless ships have a way to track one another across the void (a considerable prize), perhaps a ship's simply wishing to leave combat and her captain is doubtful of his chances of successfully disengaging under the enemy's guns. In such situations, players have the options of using the rules for a stern chase.\n\nIf two ships are not in contact and one ship flees, the other ship may pursue. If both ships are in combat, then the fleeing ship must use the Disengage Manoeuvre action. If the ship is not in combat and not within the Detection Range of any enemy ships, then it must make a Routine (+10) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. If he fails, it moves into Detection Range of those nearest enemies. They may then choose to pursue it or not. If they choose to pursue, they must have used the All Ahead Full Manoeuvre action on their last Strategic Turn and the stern chase begins.\n\nShip pursuits often take time. During a stern chase, both ships make opposed Skill Tests to accumulate a number of successes that must equal a predetermined total set by the GM or the rules below. When the stern chase begins, the GM or the rules below determine how many cumulative degrees of success are required by either the pursued ship to escape or the pursuing ship to catch its quarry.\n\nDegrees of Success Required\nIf the pursuit ship's Speed is Greater than the pursued ship's Speed, 5 degrees of success are required.\nIf the pursuit ship's Speed is Equal to the pursued ship's Speed, 10 degrees of success are required.\nIf the pursuit ship's Speed is Less than the pursued ship's Speed, 15 degrees of success are required.\n\nTo sustain the pursuit, the Explorers may attempt the following Skill Tests. For those participating in the stern chase challenge, the Test required is usually a Pilot (Space Craft) Test, though at the GM's discretion other Skills may vary and the difficulties required may vary with each Exploration Challenge. Each Explorer may Test one of these Skills once, with the default difficulty being Challenging (+0).\n\nIf the stern chase takes place in the void, all Pilot (Space Craft) and Common Lore (War) Tests receive a +10 bonus. If the Explorers manage to accumulate the cumulative degrees of success required first, they accomplish the stern chase. They bring their quarry to bay. The pursuing ship enters firing range (see below for rules of firing weapons in ship to ship combat). If they fail, they can try again, but the Explorers must succeed before their quarry escapes (perhaps slipping from Detection Range and thus becoming almost impossible to locate again). The GM should increase the difficulty of a stern chase slightly each time the Explorers fail.\n\nAlso, if the Explorers (the ones being pursued) have a faster ship and if they accumulate the required degrees of success first, they successfully escape their pursuers and may go on their way. If the Explorers are seeking to flee through asteroids or nebulas, they make the Challenge more difficult. If the Explorers started with a slow ship or they need to flee towards a warp gate a significant distance away, the GM should make the test more difficult or require a higher number of degrees of success.\n\nActive Augury\nThe character using this Active Augury grants a +10 to Detection for the remainder of the combat. The character makes a Challenging (+0) Scrutiny + Detection Test. For each degree of success, the character may scan the area surrounding the ship and gain additional information from the active scan. The GM should reveal any (and preferably all) important information about celestial bodies, phenomena, or ships within the vessel. If there is a vessel using Silent Running without a disguise, it is immediately detected.\n\nDisinformation\nThe character makes a Difficult (-10) Deceive Test. If successful, the character creates false sensor echoes that increase the effective range of his starship five VUs for every degree of success for the duration of the combat.\n\nAid the Machine Spirit\nThe character makes a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. If successful, the character provides assistance to the machine spirit and aids it in firing calculations.\n\nEmergency Repairs\nThe character makes a Difficult (-10) Tech-Use Test. If successful, he repairs one unpowered or depressurized Component. Repair attempts may be made even if the Component is damaged, though fixing a damaged Component requires a -10 penalty to the Tech-Use Test."

Unlike macrocannons which mounted along the vessel's broadsides, Lances often fire forward in a single energy projector.\n\nLock on Target\nThe character makes a Challenging (+0) Scrutiny + Detection Test.

      "text": "WEAPON FIRING ARCS\nWarships direct their weapons fire from specific locations on the hull. Supplemental Components in the form of Weapon Components provide a starship with offensive capability. A Weapon Component essentially consists of one weapon system in a single emplacement, though many components enable multiple targets for their macrocannons or lance batteries. In general, these weapons come in the following configurations: dorsal, keel, prow, port, and starboard. This determines not only which weapon is being fired, but in which direction the Component is located. Although most Weapon Components are mounted rigidly in place, scanning arrays and lance turrets allow precise targeting from the centre of their hull. For a visual representation of starship weapon arcs and how different arcs and facing applies to void-ships in combat, refer to Diagram 8-2 and 8-3.\n\nWeapon Components have the following statistics:\n\nStrength: The number of 'hits' the weapon does. For example, a macrobattery with a Strength of 4 deals 4 hits upon a successful roll.\n\nDamage: How much damage the weapon inflicts per hit.\n\nCrit Rating: The number needed to score a critical hit on the target.\n\nLocation: The section of the vessel the Weapon Component occupies. This determines in which direction the Weapon Component can fire. The main locations are Dorsal (the top of the ship), Keel (the bottom of the ship), Prow (the front of the vessel), and Port and Starboard (the left and right sides of the starship). These Weapon Components must be installed in one of the starship's Weapon Capacity slots for firing. Dorsal weapons can fire in the fore, port and starboard arcs, although different Weapon Components may fire in different arcs. Prow weapons fire forward. Port weapons fire from the left-side tops. Starboard weapons fire from the right side of the starship. Keel weapons fire from the starship's belly.\n\nRange: This is the range of the Weapon Component, measured in Void Units."

      "text": "TURRETS\nThe hull of a starship is often covered with short-range rapid-firing weapons. These could be rapid-cycling multi-lasers, man-manned laser cannons, or variable autocannons. They are collectively referred to as turrets, and they shoot down torpedoes and assault craft, as well as help defend the ship's hull during a boarding action. The Turret rating does not come from a Component, but is an inherent quality of the starship hull. Most transports and freighters have a turret rating of 1. For game purposes, a starship's Turret rating is the bonus that the ship imposes to the opposing Tests of any Hit and Run Actions directed against it. For example, a starship with a Turret rating of 2 imposes a -20 penalty to the Command Test made during a boarding action.\n\nDESTROYING SHIPS\nMost of the Critical Hit results will not outright destroy a ship. Rather, they will instead damage it in some way. This is indicative of the nature of spacecraft in Rogue Trader. Ships are rarely completely destroyed; badly damaged hulks are salvaged and rebuilt. The Critical Hit chart when dealing with an NPC vessel if it is reduced to zero Hull Integrity changes in the following manner. When the starship reaches zero Hull Integrity, the Critical Hit Chart changes to reflect it drifting away as a burnt hulk, and the crew is either dead or striving for survival. This means any NPC ship will suffer the effects on Critical Hits regardless of its Hull Integrity. Whether from doing damage past zero Hull Integrity or from a Weapon Component's Crit Rating (which determines the modification means a critical shot when the target ship suffers a -10 penalty to its Ballistic Skill Test). However, when determining if a critical is scored, if the target is hit and the damage roll is a 10, the attacker automatically scores a Critical Hit.\n\nWhen firing macrobatteries, each macrobattery containing multiple cannons fires only a single shot, though a macrocannon might inflict additional damage in the form of a Critical Hit. Even all of the macrobatteries comprising a broadside, if the macrobatteries all share the same stats (Strength, Damage, and Crit Rating) and a character or NPC are firing them at the same ship, the attacks can be resolved with a single Ballistic Skill Test with only one Critical Hit applied. Each Weapon Component should be treated separately, even if they fire simultaneously. (This allows calculating the number of macrobattery dice to roll and determine which void shields were up.)\n\nAdding the totals from each roll together then applying this to Hull Integrity makes some significant combat runs more smooth in their resolution. For example, instead of rolling the dice and determining the effects for each macrobattery individually, a starship directing the firing has a single dice pool. The ship combines all the macrocannons, fires them together, and applies each damage result. This makes a ship combining multiple hits into a group entire more devastating if the chooser.\n\nDAMAGE AND DEFENCES\nThe most important defensive technologies in the 41st millennium must include starship voids shields. These systems combine advanced technology with the simple physics of creating vast energy fields. First, they push aside swaths of dust and detritus while creating a bubble around the ship, then rebound incoming ordnance. The defences of a starship are threefold.\n\nVoid shields create a barrier encircling the starship (though they offer little protection against certain specific attacks). A starship's void shields are represented by its void shield rating. If a ship suffers a hit, plus one additional hit per three degrees of success, a void shield collapses. This means that before a ship fires, the defender applies these defences separately.\n\nArmour represents thick, energy dense metal plating the outer hull of the starship. Whenever a shot manages to break through the void shields, the armour rating is subtracted from the damage before it is applied to Hull Integrity.\n\nWhen the character decides to fire on another ship during its turn, the target ship's void shields absorb a number of hits equal to the strength of the shield. In other words, if a ship has two void shields and suffers 5 hits, the defender determines the total number of void shields the attacker overcomes. If the attacker manages to do more damage than can be stopped by the void shields, the ship suffers actual Hull Integrity damage. After the void shields are down, determine the total number of successful hits. Once all shields are gone, the ship takes damage directly to its Hull Integrity."

      "text": "If a ship has 3 shields, it does not matter if the hits are from macrocannons or Lance batteries—the shields reduce damage the same way. Void shields refresh at the rate they were knocked down. Any hits that exceed the defensive shields fired whilst the turn by the attacking ship will also penetrate and damage the defending ship. After shields are down, the void shields will recover. The void shields will refresh one per Strategic Round until the ship reaches its maximum rating.\n\nA QUESTION OF SCALE\nStarships and their weapons operate at a completely different scale than any other form of fighting in the 41st Millennium. The question often arises: what happens to a starship and those aboard it if someone decides to fire a hand weapon, or even a tank's cannon, at a warship? Conversely, what might happen if ships firing at each other accidentally hit a person standing on the hull? The answers to such questions are obvious: just as a child wields a stick against a mountain, the results would be horrifying if they were reversed. Most starship weapons are designed to crack other large cruiser-class vessels—a High Admiral could shell a planet with macro batteries for days before damaging it beyond recovery. The basic game mechanics represent a starship and its weapons—but if it happens that a unfortunate is caught in the crossfire, they are atomized. On a related note, the amount of damage a laser pistol might inflict on a Cruiser would be the same as applying a flashlight to someone's skin—they might not even notice.\n\nIf a ship has 0 shields remaining and all remaining hits rolled are added together, a ship suffering 6 damage becomes Crippled (and considered to have 0 Hull Integrity). This effect occurs until it receives repairs. Crippled ships take damage past their Threshold as a modifier to the roll on the Critical Hit chart. If the total damage would reduce the Hull Integrity below 0, the ship suffers a Critical Hit. Compare the value of the damage to the ship's Hull Integrity to determine how many points of damage the ship suffers past its threshold (or how tough the opponent is). The amount of damage a ship takes past its Hull Integrity value will be reflected on the Critical Hit Chart.\n\nEXAMPLE\nAn incoming macrocannon shot strikes the Explorers' vessel, the Executrix. The gunner firing the weapon has a Ballistic Skill of 45. The ship has a Crit Rating of 8 and when it strikes a crippled ship, it deals Critical Hits on a roll of 7-10. The Critical Hit requires a modifier equal to the number of Hull Integrity points the Executrix is below 0. Since the Executrix is at -4 Hull Integrity, the attacker receives a +4 to his roll. The Critical Hit chart has a roll of 1d100, so the GM rolls a 72. Adding the +4 modifier for the Hull Integrity below 0, the total is 76, resulting in the \"Link Lance Coils\" Critical Hit.\n\nCRIPPLED SHIPS\nWhen a ship reaches 0 Hull Integrity, it becomes Crippled. More than a minor inconvenience, Crippled is a starship's death knell from enemies, the cold void, and the inability to flee to shelter. When Crippled, a ship suffers a -10 to Maneuverability and Detection. In addition, reduce the strength of all Weapon Components by half (round up). A ship will struggle when attacking, firing weapons, turning sharply, sending signals, and may have difficulty detecting other ships in range due to damage to its augurs."

Roll 1d10 to determine which sensor array was torn away or damaged (GM's choice, recommend external sensors located outside the hull).\n\nThrusters damaged: The ship's maneuvering thrusters are damaged. The vessel is unable to maneuver, albeit slowly. Reduce the ship's Maneuverability bonus by -20 until repaired. If the Thrusters cannot be repaired, the GM should consider that Component unpowered (apply relevant rules for unpowered Components).\n\nEngines Crippled: Something pierces a drive intake in the ship's stern, venting plasma into the void.

Roll 1d10. On a roll of 9-10, the ship takes 1d5 damage (explosive).  For rolls of 3-8, the fire is contained to the Component.

The GM should randomly select a Component for the fire to begin, based on principles of logical location (consider that it's more likely a fire would spread from the plasma drives throughout the vessel and possibly the entire ship). Any character who attempts firefighting should make a Difficult (-10) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test to avoid the flames spreading.\n\nDEPRESSURISATION\nThis counts as an Extended Action and therefore may only affect one Component. When depressurizing a Component, the character must make a Difficult (-10) Command Test to vent the fire out into the void. The fire is extinguished immediately, and the Component is now depressurized instead. Each occupant in the Component suffers the effects of vacuum and suffers only 1d5 Crew Population damage. Intentionally depressurizing a Component or setting compartments to be vented into the void deliberately causes 1d10 damage to Crew Population and Morale. The damage to the ship is reduced, burned-out hulks and damaged Components can be repaired later (although a depressurized Component cannot be damaged by fire unless atmospheric containment is breached somehow)."

Any repair conducted on damaged Components is unpowered. Emergency lighting often flickers, instantly decreasing morale.\n\nFire: When a Component is on fire, all occupants immediately take 1d5 damage. When fire spreads, it also affects Crew Population and Morale (see page 223). The fire damage cannot normally be stopped until the Component is completely destroyed. Anyone occupying a Component without a breathing aid (such as a void suit) suffers automatically. In general, a Component without life sustaining characteristics will kill a victim (the GM should determine how long the Component will remain without breathable atmosphere). Another common effect is a horrific death. Anyone occupying a damaged Component while the ship is in combat suffers automatic damage (see page 260).\n\nDepressurized Component: Gas vents out to the void and the Component is effectively destroyed. A Component may sometimes be repressurized if it hasn't been twisted and warped past the point of no return. Any character in a depressurized Component suffers vacuum (see page 260).\n\nDestroyed Component: These Components must be moved. The GM selects a Component and determines if it has sustained irreversible damage. This damage often involves structural bulkhead failures, twisted corridors, and a thousand other small catastrophes that end Component functionality. A Component that is destroyed can't be used. The GM should randomly select the Component using a rollable d10 and determine the extent of logical location and damage. For example, if the Plasma Drive Component (Component 1) was destroyed, there is a high chance that fire could spread from the plasma drives throughout the vessel and possibly the entire ship.

The ship loses a Component randomly, representing an entire portion of the ship abandoned due to lack of crew. All other Actions suffer a -20 penalty. The ship cannot enter combat. Any damage to Hull Integrity leads to an additional 1d10 damage to Hull Integrity. All ship systems go haywire; automated systems malfunction and the ship begins to break up.\n11-20 | The ship loses Weapon Components randomly after a Strategic Turn. After a failed Repair Action, the ship loses 1d5 Hull Integrity. Boarding Actions automatically fail. The ship increases emergency broadcasts, which can be detected from 5 VUs, alerting nearby threats.\n21-30 | Attempting to Repair damage requires a Very Hard (-30) Test. Only specific Command Actions can be taken. All pilot Maneuvers suffer a -10 penalty in a Strategic Turn. All Ballistic Skill Tests suffer a -10 penalty. Emergency Repairs, such as manually operating weapons, logically require tech-priests to allocate themselves across the ship. The ship's systems slowly become more difficult to maintain.\n31-40 | The ship functions at a minimum. All pilots must make an Easy (+30) Pilot (Space Craft) Test during a Strategic Round. The ship functions adequately, though some systems begin to fail. All Tech-Use Tests suffer a -10 penalty. Sensors increase in difficulty to use. All Command Tests suffer a -10 penalty.\n\nGRAVITY\nMaintaining gravity is something most captains take for granted. The Imperium maintains the mystical Dark Age technology allowing the simulation of gravity effects—a marvel to the Explorator and a blessing to the Imperial Guard trooper found to be floating in the direction of a traitor, mutant, or willful data construct in the GunCutter's passenger bay. However, all of these systems face problems with poor maintenance, battle damage, exposure to the void, or informal Tech-Priest admonishments for sounds unbecoming of a starship's drive core. Additionally, when systems fail and power cannot be diverted to maintain gravity, crew members striding the decks may find themselves floating above the valley of steel and into areas precariously positioned within the hull.\n\nCREW POPULATION AND MORALE\nThe health and wellbeing of a starship's crew is paramount. The effects of the warp, plague, or void can cause Crew Population and Morale damage. Crew Population represents how many people are likely to survive and manage the ship. Therefore, if a ship normally carries 100 people and the Crew Population was 90, this means 90% of the ship's original crew complement can still function while 10% are injured, killed, or otherwise incapacitated. All ships' Crew Population is measured on a 100 scale; starship components usually require certain Crew Population thresholds to maintain normal function. Morale represents the crew's loyalty and is also measured on a 100 scale, starting at 100. With both Morale and Crew Population, if either falls below a certain threshold, where that threshold begins is depicted on the following charts. The charts also show something pushed off from whatever the value is below that threshold.\n\nTABLE 8-14: MORALE\nMorale Number | Effect\n0-10 | Command Tests made to direct the crew immediately fail. The ship cannot aim weapons or perform any Maneuvers. Command Tests to inspire the crew can still be attempted, but they suffer a -40 penalty.\n11-20 | Command Tests automatically fail. The crew can no longer be trusted to follow orders. No Command Tests involving the crew may be made or attempted within a Strategic Round. The Command Tests made to restore Morale receive a -30 penalty.\n21-30 | The crew begins a full mutiny. None of the officers can control authority. They can attempt to impose their will with a Very Hard (-30) Command Test. Only characters with the Master and Commander Talent may attempt a Command Test. All other Command Tests fail. Once Morale falls to this level, mutiny can only be stopped through force or bribery."

      "text": "The effects of Population and Morale are unavoidable, but the effects are reversible. If the Crew Population or Morale are ever brought above the threshold level, all effects from that Population and Morale effects are removed. For example, if the ship's Crew Population is 35, the most difficult Command Test is Hard (-20), while the chart for Morale states that if Crew Population is above 31, the Crew Population penalties are lifted. Once Crew Population is restored to 41, the penalties from Morale are no longer in effect.\n\nIn addition, ship actions are modified by Morale below certain thresholds. A particularly obnoxious NPC might cause a -10 to Crew Morale. Forcing the crew to abandon action causes a -10 to Morale. Retreating from combat turns down the panic meter one notch.\n\nNote: If the ship is in combat when Morale drops below 30 (or other threshold with similar effects), the effects apply until after the combat ends. If Morale drops below the mutiny threshold, until the cause of the ship's plummeting Morale (the opposing ship, perhaps, or the enemy that the players have been asked to retrieve) has been dealt with, the GM should choose one NPC (preferably a quarter-master or a general crewmember). The mutineer threatens to expose or worsen the situation amid battle and should be a character who would have reason to be on the bridge. The opposing NPC should have a clear cut goal defined (perhaps access to the life sustainer controls). The characters should face opposed Skill Tests from that NPC trying to accomplish the goal (even if the goal is to commandeer the ship, which is a remarkably dangerous task). While the players slog through the opposition, the crew (which, remember, is directly represented by the Morale statistic) could break out into mutiny.\n\nFor the character, this could be an opposed Skill Test. If the ship suffers a single point of Crew Population damage during that time, the mutiny leader might barricade himself and his men in the life sustainer controls and vent the breathing compartments to outer space. Perhaps they could fight their way to the leader, addressing their demands and trying to re-establish communications. The mutineers would make an opposed Command Test against the ship's captain, while the characters engage in opposed Skill Tests. If the characters win, the ship suffers 1d10 Morale damage (the characters win!) but the mutiny ends. If the characters win and the mutineers lose any of these opposed Skill Tests, the mutineers realize the consequences of their actions.\n\nIf the characters win, combat continues; however, if the mutineers win on three of these opposed Skill Tests (or perhaps three degrees of success), the mutiny succeeds. The characters lose control of their ship and will likely be forced to abandon it and flee quickly, lest they be killed by the former crew (or the alien menace the crew was trying to flee from in the first place).\n\nEXAMPLE\nThe boarding action ends in a disaster for the Explorers. The Measured Response has suffered a brutal firefight against cultists who had infiltrated the ship, causing damage to Crew Population and Morale. After the fight ends, the ship's Morale is at 25. Since Morale has dropped below 30, the characters must roll opposed Command Tests and either bargain with the crew or face mutiny (see page 227 for more information). The captain rolls against his Command Skill of 60 (with a -30 penalty for low Morale). His result is a 47—success! He convinces the senior NCO member that abandoning the cultists at this particular moment, especially if they are press-ganged into service on their Command (the GM has determined that sufficient criminal elements may wish to continue working for the captain), is prudent. The captain promises some port leave and additional recreation time (reducing his Achievement Points by 50). Failure could mean that other criminal elements take control, or perhaps a response team from a nearby population might seek to eliminate these unusual visitors. After all, who defends a mutineer?\n\nREPLENISHING MORALE AND CREW POPULATION\nRestoring a ship's Morale is often surprisingly easy. For centuries, Rogue Trader dynasties have understood the psychology of a starship crew. The family of a starship crew are all void-born or sky-farers, often content with life's simple pleasures. They simply want their patrons to earn profits and distribute a share to allow them to purchase pleasures and ensure their family's dominance within the ship's society and class structure.\n\nIf the starship is currently involved in attempting to complete an Endeavour (see Chapter XIII: Endeavours), the easiest approach would be to bribe the crew with 100 Achievement Points (or the same amount in Profit Factor, at the ship's captain's discretion). This immediately increases the ship's Crew Population or Morale by 1d10+10 (the player's choice). For each additional 100 spent toward that Endeavour, the captain can further increase Morale by the same amount (1d10+10).\n\nBut there are other ways to address the crew's needs. During tradition with their galley transports, the captain could make an Easy (+20) Charm Test to rally the morale of his crew. A successful test increases Morale by 1d5 for each degree of success (to a maximum of +20). However, the difficulty of the test should increase by one level (from Easy to Routine, from Routine to Challenging, etc.) each time this approach is used within a day. This reflects the crew's growing weariness of their captain's speeches.\n\nThe captain could also try intimidating the crew with a Difficult (-10) Intimidate Test. Succeeding at this test increases Morale by 1d10 for each degree of success the captain achieves (to a maximum of +20). However, for every degree of failure, Morale decreases by 1d5. This indicates the crew doesn't respond well to being browbeaten.\n\nOf course, the best solution would be to dock the ship at an Imperial void station or, better still, a inhabited planet with fresh air for the crew and new supplies. This would restore their Morale fully. Crew Population can be replenished by recruiting new void-farers or officers from amenable populations. Making an Acquisition Test to find suitable crew members requires a -10 penalty for strange or unusual species. This reflects the time necessary to secure the necessary materials and find qualified applicants. However, the GM should feel free to modify this based on circumstance. On a docked ship or at a repair station, a successful Difficult (-10) Charm or Intimidate Test would assist in securing qualified crew members from among the local population. After a successful Acquisition Test is made, Crew Population increases by 1d5."

      "text": "SPACE TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF COMBAT\nRegular space travel should be treated abstractly. The distance between planets in the same system shouldn't take more than a day or two to travel at standard cruising speeds. Imperial starships generally travel at approximately 0.5 light years per day. This means that if a starship wanted to travel from one planet to another planet within the same system, it shouldn't take much longer than that to reach its destination. Of course, the GM should consider phenomena such as asteroid fields, ice rings, and other dangers that would require extended Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Tests to navigate. The availability of the starship should also depend on the nature of the location and the ability to defend against outside dangers, such as a world ravaged by meteor impacts or inhabited by hostile populations. Most warp-capable vessels require a Routine (+10) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test to navigate through known and relatively safe celestial passages; using the default Manoeuvre Action. Failure imposes its own consequences (for example, the ship may drift off course) while harder tests often lead to longer transit times or worse alternatives. Given sufficient time, the GM can amplify the consequences of repeated failures. Celestial phenomena are often hazardous and dangerous. This section contains several common interstellar dangers that explorers may face while traversing the void.\n\nStarvation: When a starship's food stores are insufficient, Morale decreases dramatically. Every day the crew does not find a habitable planet or receive supplies, Morale loses 1d5 points. Of course, the threat of mutiny is always present when Crews face survival scenarios. Explorers may make an Acquisition Test with a -10 penalty to find fresh air for their crew. This represents finding necessary materials and quality supplies. Morale loss stops, but the crew suffers a -5 penalty to their Morale for 1d4 days. If Morale falls below the mutinous threshold (see the Crew Morale chart) and the Explorers cannot restore it, mutiny occurs. This typically manifests as deck riots, treacherous mid-rank officers soliciting armed escorts against the captain, or other actions that the GM considers appropriate. Rather than focus on the mutiny, the GM should make it clear the ship is in trouble and must seek repairs elsewhere (preferably at an Imperial-sanctioned world).\n\nEXTENDED REPAIRS\nExplorers may take time between sessions to restore a significant amount of their damaged Hull Integrity and components. Success is largely automated since these repairs will be sufficient. Rather than fail to repair a damaged Hull Integrity or Component (whether unpowered, damaged, or destroyed), the Explorer makes an Extended Repair Action (normally, Tech-Use Tests) that restores Hull Integrity and burned-out Components or replaces destroyed Components pulled from hull remains and additional hulks. This would occur within normal operations (docked and refueled).\n\nThough supplies are seldom enough to completely repair a starship (especially if inflicted through the Early Mastery Agreement), they are enough to get the ship voyageworthy again. An extended repair within a starship should reach a dockyards or a drydock facility. Perhaps high orbit around a pleasure planet, or a different setting near a base asteroid—a detection lure if crew will be on-board during the repairs. The GM determines how many weeks of game time are required for the work, and the ship's captain must direct one crewmember to make a Tech-Use Test each week for the duration of the repairs he wishes to undertake. If the test succeeds, the ship regains 1d5 points of Hull Integrity. This cannot take the ship above its original Hull Integrity. If the test fails, though, the ship remains in its damaged state.\n\nA successful Tech-Use Test can also restore one damaged or depressurized Component to full working order. Destroyed Components must be repurchased and replaced, though a successful Tech-Use Test can return the Component to full function once the replacement parts have been obtained. Most starships' hull need repairs while landed on planets capable of space operations—preferably a Forge World with tech-priests and manufactoria rather than feudal peasants repairing the afterburners of a starship. Other materials can also be repaired:\n• Hull Integrity can be restored\n• Damaged and depressurized Components can be restored to working order\n• Weapon systems can be repaired after being damaged"

      "text": "Asteroid Field\nAsteroid fields can provide weapon range for ships hidden within debris fields. Though passing through an asteroid field unscathed is not difficult, for every degree of failure on a Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test, the ship takes 1d5 + 1 damage. Furthermore, asteroid fields are common starship hiding places. A ship making a Silent Running Manoeuvre gains a +30 to its Manoeuvre Tests within an asteroid field, though other ships using Augur Arrays within the field may detect the ship.\n\nThe asteroid field makes a ship harder to hit. Any Ballistic Skill Tests targeting a ship within an asteroid field become more difficult by one step (a Challenging Test would become Difficult, for example).\n\nGravity Tides\nAround planets and stellar bodies, weaker warp currents can suddenly become dangerous, requiring a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test. Repeating this test is often required, especially for large or bulky ships. Making this test is normally a Half Action that doesn't count against the default Manoeuvre Action. Failure means the ship veers off and must make a Hard (-20) Navigation (Stellar) + Detection Test to find its way. For each degree of failure on this secondary test, the ship must spend an extra day getting to its destination.\n\nTHE DEEP VOID\nBeyond planetary systems lies the deep void. Experienced captains know that the harsh and fickle vacuum is genuinely filled with terror—unusual gravitational disturbances, pockets of radiation, cold spots so unforgiving it freezes human blood, or torn space-time from unusual phenomena like unstable warp portals or damages in the fabric of reality that interface with dimensions beyond human comprehension.\n\nNavigating the deep void requires a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test for standard travel. Though Imperial charts and ancient maps claim that only the bravest and best pilots can navigate this space, many captains maintain that if given enough speed and calculation time, they could reach any system. Navigation requires a Challenging (+0) Navigation (Stellar) + Detection Test. The safer route between two points is generally well known, and though sometimes encountering hazards is beyond the Explorer's control, the GM should be fair and reasonable when determining encounters. When a starship enters deep space beyond the boundaries of the Imperium where the light of civilization is farthest away, journeys could even take decades or months (although the warp supplies shown on most void charts are often conservatively estimated). The longer ships stay out of range of ports, stations, and Imperial fields, the more dangerous a voyage becomes. Ships with no Gellar Field and life sustaining components begin to dwindle; each month (or after certain encounters, at the GM's discretion), the ship may roll 1d10 damage to Crew Population and Morale. Catastrophic failure should wait until a climactic moment. Once per month, characters can make a successful Medicae Test (difficulty determined by the GM) to prevent the crew from suffering 1d5 Crew Population and Morale damage.\n\nScurvy: Severe food makes for poor nutrition. Life without proper nutrients or exercise causes the loss of teeth and bone density. The lack of proper minerals and vitamins means crew members are brought low. When traveling through the deep void, starship crews often develop nasty ailments and diseases.\n\nNebulae\nNavigating through a nebula requires a Difficult (-10) Navigation (Stellar) + Detection Test to find the proper course, but failure means the ship is lost within 1d5 days due to debris and sensor failure. For every degree of failure, the ship must spend an extra day getting to its destination.\n\nPlanet Rings\nPlanetary rings are dense areas of space debris. When passing through a ring, the character must make a Challenging (+0) Pilot (Space Craft) + Detection Test. Failure results in 1d10 damage to the ship, ignoring void shields. Every degree of failure causes an additional 1d5 damage."

      "text": "STELLAR PHENOMENA IN COMBAT\nWithout a full shipyard, sometimes repairs are often improvised. In such cases, the GM should select a Component. Although the ship can move through space without making the dangerous calculations, the GM can amplify the danger if the ship is near a civilized planet for piracy. The character must make a Routine (+10) Tech-Use Test or the Component becomes damaged. Tests to repair stellar phenomena should become progressively harder (and making the calculations should become progressively harder as time goes on).\n\nFood Shortage\nStarvation: If a starship's food and water run short, the captain must make a Routine (+10) Pilot (Space Craft) + Maneuverability Test to herein the starship accesses the local food (this makes the default Manoeuvre Action). Failure imposes morale threats that should remain unless countered. Mutiny is just that much closer. If the situation is not fixed for longer than a month, the captain cannot make ship-wide Morale Tests. Every Feature Field is drastically reduced from Morale loss. Once the ship runs short of supplies, it can suddenly become dangerous to be aboard the ship. Morale Every day that the Rogue Trader does not find a habitable planet, he rolls 1d5 and loses that many Morale points. Of course, the threat of mutiny is always present when Crews get hungry. Every full four points of Hull Integrity created by a confined within iron bulkheads; without the warm sun and fresh air for extended periods, the Explorers must make an Acquisition Test with a -10 penalty to find fresh foodstuffs. This phenomena takes one week to manifest and the ship suffers Morale loss, but the GM should feel free to decrease the Morale by 1d4 per month. If a Morale Test is failed, the Explorers must face Mutineers: mutinous mid-deck men and traitorous mid-ranking officers soliciting the loyalty of the common ratings. When that occurs, the Rogue Trader must make a Command Test. More reliable crew seek repairs elsewhere (preferably at an acquisition port).\n\nEXTENDED REPAIRS\nRepairs to Hull Integrity do not count against the number of Acquisitions an Explorer may make. During Extended periods in the void, Machine Spirit meets its demands, as the crew laboriously restores the severely-afflicted vessel. Rather than in the Extended Repairs section, Components (whether damaged, depressurized, unpowered, void-firing) must be restored before they will function normally. Extended Repairs replace destroyed bulkheads, fill up fuel and install shields with additional Components purchased and created from salvage of derelicts and resources acquired from nearby systems. It takes additional days to install per Component.\n\nUsing Scavenging skill and Weld over hull breaches: Though supplies are seldom enough to completely repair starships (especially those traveling through the Dark Expanse of the Koronus region), they are enough to get ships which lack functions repaired. Certain starships should remain within extended periods of space, perhaps high orbit around planets or different sections of a sparse asteroid field where their detection is lowered. A crew will be orchestrated by the ship's captain each week, forming maintenance crews. In directing them, make a Tech-Use Test. The degrees of failure and degree of success affect how effective the repairs are. If the repair has successfully been completed, the ship regains 1d5 points of Hull Integrity. This cannot take the ship above its Hull Integrity Maximum. A repair attempt can only be used on depleted Hull Integrity (not destroyed Components or on a ship in full working order). Destroyed Components can be repurchased and replaced (through Acquisition) at starships docked at a civilized planet or space station—preferably an Imperial World with access to rare parts were many Mechanicus adepts are stationed. When repairing:\n\nHull Integrity is restored\nDamaged or unpowered Components are restored to working order\nAll depressurized areas are repaired\nA benefit might be gained for a short period of time"

      "text": "CHAPTER IX:\nPLAYING THE GAME\n\nTo properly chronicle a Rogue Trader's journey across the stars requires a balance of action and humor and sufficient experience to know what gets the best job done. While players provide the decision-making experience for their explorer character, this game provides the mechanics—a rules set to determine success or failure.\n\nEXAMPLE\nMaster Seneschal Nurin Tanthros is trying to scan the Silver Mote. The GM decides that Silver Mote is not currently putting out a regular signal experience, so Nurin must use his Scrutiny Skill at half his Intelligence characteristic. Nurin has an Intelligence of 42, so his Scrutiny Skill at half would be 21. With a single roll of the percentile dice, the roll is 43. That's higher than Nurin's modified skill rating of 21, so he fails to detect any anomalies aboard the Silver Mote.\n\nTESTS\n\nCHARACTERISTIC TESTS\nSometimes a character attempts to do something not covered by a Skill. In such cases, a Characteristic Test is the way to determine success or failure. Instead of using a Skill Test, the GM determines the most appropriate Characteristic for the test, and the player's explorer rolls against that Characteristic. If the roll is equal to or less than the target's Characteristic, the test succeeds. If the roll is greater than the target's Characteristic, the test fails. Degrees of success matter when determining the commander's resolution of the ship's orders.\n\nSKILL TESTS\n\nTABLE 9-1: SKILL TESTS\nType of Skill | Tested as\n--------------|----------\nUntrained | Half Characteristic\nTraining in a Basic Skill | Full Characteristic\nAdvanced Skill | Full Characteristic + 10\n\nTABLE 9-2: CHARACTERISTICS TESTS\nCharacteristic | Example Tests\n---------------|---------------\nWeapon Skill | Melee strikes\nBallistic Skill | Ranged attacks\nStrength | Force objects, resist\nToughness | Resist poison, element\nAgility | Balance, catch, tumble\nIntelligence | Recall facts, perceive\nPerception | Notice, sound out\nWillpower | Resist fear, psychic power\nFellowship | Charm, deceive"

Sometimes, however, it is useful to know how well the test succeeded or how badly it failed; this is particularly important with social Skills like Charm and Intimidate, as well as with semi-automatic and fully automatic burst fire.\n\nEXAMPLE\nTulsanti Firebrand is attempting to convince a guard to let her pass. She has a Fellowship of 35 and rolls a 25 on her percentile roll. Since she succeeded at her test with a difference of 10 points, she has one degree of success. The GM rules that the guards are impressed with Tulsanti's smooth talk.\n\nEXTENDED TESTS\nWhen using Skill or Characteristic Tests for especially complicated or lengthy challenges, the GM may require Extended Tests. For these types of tests, the character needs a certain number of degrees of success to complete the task. This is known as an Extended Test. Generally, the skill in question describes whether or not it requires an Extended Test, though the GM may adjust the time represented by each Test (better chance of completing the task) depending on the circumstances."

      "text": "ASSISTANCE\nIn most cases, multiple characters working together are better at completing the task than a single character working alone. With the GM's permission, a character that is actually performing the test rolls dice. Then, another character that is also helping with the test, but not actually performing the test, rolls dice as well. Assisting reduces the difficulty by one step. If the characters helping both succeed, the test succeeds, and the character performing the test also gains a bonus degree of success.\n\nOPPOSED TESTS\nSometimes a character is pitting himself against another. For example, an explorer trying to hide would use his Concealment Skill against a guard's Awareness Skill. This is an Opposed Test with two participants. Normally, whoever succeeds at his test wins. If both participants succeed, the one with the higher Characteristic (or the one with the most degrees of success) wins. If both degrees of success are tied, the one with the highest Characteristic (or highest Skill) value wins. If both characters fail their tests, the result is a stalemate (unless there are special circumstances when one or the other would succeed by default). The tests may be repeated until there is a clear victor or until the GM brings appropriate resolution.\n\nLIMITS ON ASSISTANCE\nCharacters can assist each other in most tasks, but there are some limits. No more than 50 percent improvement may attempt to gain the bonus for assisting.\n\nEXAMPLE\nNobleblood takes a shot at a Dark Eldar raider with his plasma pistol. The GM says that because the shot is difficult, Nobleblood must make a Difficult (-10) Ballistic Skill Test. Dark Eldar are hard to hit. Nobleblood has a Ballistic Skill of 47, but the -10 penalty for this challenging shot decreases that to 37 for this Test. Nobleblood rolls a 26 on his percentile roll—a success! The GM rules that Nobleblood's shot connects, dealing damage to his enemy.\n\nEXAMPLE\nHydrobius is trying to get away from a Dark Eldar warrior. The GM calls for an Opposed Test. The Dark Eldar will use his Awareness skill to see if he can spot Hydrobius. Hydrobius makes an Ordinary (+10) Concealment Test (since he's in a cluttered corridor) with a 40 degree of success. The Dark Eldar warrior makes an Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test with a 30 degree of success. Hydrobius succeeds with more degrees of success than his opponent, so he slips by undetected.\n\nTEST DIFFICULTY\nNot all tests are of equal difficulty. Landing a transport on a peaceful agri-world is routine, but doing the same on a high-speed Deathworld is clearly harder. In the latter case, the GM would decide the difficulty and then determine the appropriate modifier. The test difficulty modifies the Skill or Characteristic value before the percentile roll. In summary, first, the GM would determine the appropriate difficulty, then would determine the appropriate modifier.\n\nTABLE 9-3: TEST DIFFICULTY\nDifficulty | Modifier | Target\n-----------|----------|-------\nEasy | +30 | Everyday\nRoutine | +20 | Familiar\nOrdinary | +10 | Simple\nChallenging | +0 | Tricky\nDifficult | -10 | Hard\nHard | -20 | Demanding\nVery Hard | -30 | Extreme\n\nEXAMPLE\nNobleman Waarden is trying to convince a local Lord to let him access his protected family archives. The GM rules that this is a Difficult (-10) Fellowship Lore Test. Instead of using his full Fellowship score of 45, Waarden only adds a 35 when rolling the percentile dice. This represents how difficult it is for a Lord to grant access to family documents to an outsider."

      "text": "THE ROLE OF FATE\nSTARSHIPS AND BURNING FATE\nBattles in deep space that involve starships are deadly. Void combat dominates the lives of those who sail through the stars. When a vessel rides the tides of the Warp, the crew faces breaking points where one moment of hesitation can lead to something destructive. Voyages that were thought routine become perilous when faced with damaged or reactivated debris where only extinction awaits. In such extreme circumstances, explorers are encouraged to burn a Fate Point permanently in order to escape the situation and ensure the survival of the ship.\n\nExcept for those who have Fate Points to burn, it is entirely possible and likely that the explorers began play with a vessel that has suffered damage. The GM decides just how many Fate Points each explorer began play with and which are determined at character creation. For warships with a past history, every character on the ship must burn a Fate Point. The manner of the starship's survival is a narrative event for the GM and players to discuss. Typically, the ship is fortunate enough to escape from the combat and the GM may reveal one another piece of history at his discretion.\n\nUSING FATE POINTS\nAn explorer is running low on ammunition, bleeding profusely from multiple wounds, and noting more risks which he must take. As an explorer depletes his personal pool of Fate Points and no reinforcements are coming, his future looks bleak. Fate Points are regained at the beginning of a gaming session, possibly later if the Explorer is fortunate or has gained a substantial amount of profit. Once spent, a Fate Point is gone from the explorer's pool of Fate Points until the GM deems appropriate. Such rewards are at the GM's discretion, but Fate Points can be regained for completing missions, succeeding at particularly difficult Tests, or winning a high-stakes engagement. The normal usage of spending a Fate Point allows for one of the following:\n\nTo re-roll the dice\nTo gain an extra degree of success (This only affects Tests, not Damage rolls)\nHaving rolled 10, it explodes! Roll another D10 and add the result\n+1d5 Damage (this cannot affect Critical Damage)\nIgnoring Fatigue or stunning effects for one Round\n\nBURNING FATE\nCommander Xan races from the bridge, not having enough time to warn his explorer's life. Many imperial explorers would burn a Fate Point permanently. This means its loss, but would in turn allow his life to be saved when death should have claimed him; instead he has a chance to continue his adventure. For extreme circumstances, being trapped by alien life forms or while a ship drifts aimlessly through space, the explorer's player may burn a Fate Point and the explorer makes his escape. Though these Fate Points have been used, the actual method and means of their escape should be determined by the GM."

      "text": "COMBAT\nCOMBAT ABSTRACTIONS\nCombat in Rogue Trader is fast and furious, designed to emulate the deadly dangers faced by the explorers. The 41st Millennium is a dangerous place, especially for those who venture beyond the relative safety of established Imperial worlds. In the interests of creating an entertaining game system that does not become bogged down with minutiae, the rules take certain licenses with reality. One such assumption is that combatants are constantly moving and jockeying for position during the fight. One such assumption is that people are not standing completely motionless waiting their turn to attack or defend. Unless the explorers are pinned down and are constantly 'leapfrogging' to cover their mates, they are moving and selecting the most favourable combat positions. With this in mind, the Rogue Trader rules eschew firing lines and other tactical concerns. The default difficulty of most Tests in Rogue Trader combat actions is Challenging (+0), and the action relates to other combatants. Ship and vehicle combat is explained in Chapter VII: Starships and Vehicles.\n\nWhen running large-scale combats involving dozens or even hundreds of combatants, refer to Chapter XI: The Game Master. Each character gets to act once each Round and normally can perform Actions while under fire. Turns overlap each other slightly; the Game Master resolves each Action as it happens in Initiative Order (see page 236).\n\nNARRATIVE TIME VS. STRUCTURED TIME\nThe passage of time in Rogue Trader and similar roleplaying games is subject to the GM's discretion. Most of the story is told in Narrative Time, where the choices players make during the game are not subject to strict time measurements. The GM only refrains to pinpoint exactly when events occur. A character is performing multiple Actions during his Turn, the exact order in which they are resolved may or may not matter. For precise time sensitive activities, the GM should adopt Structured Time, which is laid out below. For example, a character could draw his weapon and then shoot, or he could shoot first and then draw a second weapon - either way the end result is the same. All Actions are described in detail on page 238.\n\nNARRATIVE TIME\nMany scenes in Rogue Trader do not require strict time keeping. Usually combat lasts a few minutes, travel about an hour or several weeks.\n\nSTRUCTURED TIME\nCombat and other dangerous situations are usually resolved using Structured Time, divided into Rounds, Turns, and Actions. Each character, including NPCs, gets one Turn to act each Round. When each participant in a conflict gets to act is determined by his Initiative Order. When all participants have taken a Turn, the Round ends and a new Round begins. This approach to game timekeeping is important for resolving complex encounters such as combat.\n\nSTEP 1: SURPRISE\nAt the beginning of combat, determine which characters, if any, are Surprised. This step only happens once at the beginning of an interaction, as there may be combats where nobody is Surprised. Characters who are Surprised cannot act during the first Round of combat. If all enemies are Surprised, then the combat immediately proceeds to Step Two. Characters who are not Surprised may act normally according to their Initiative, while Surprised characters simply lose their Turns for the Round.\n\nSTEP 2: ROLL INITIATIVE\nAt the start of the first Round (after determining if anyone is Surprised), each character rolls 1d10 and adds his Agility Bonus (the tens digit of his Agility characteristic). This Initiative roll applies for all successive Rounds in the combat."
    },
    {
      "pageIndex": 238,
      "text": "STEP 3: DETERMINE INITIATIVE ORDER\nThe GM ranks all Initiative rolls including those of NPCs from highest to lowest. The order in which the characters take their Turns is called the Initiative Order. If there is a tie between the Initiative of two characters, the character with the higher Agility characteristic goes first. If the Initiative and Agility are tied, the GM may decide the ordering, or have the players roll again to determine who goes first.\n\nSTEP 4: COMBATANTS TAKE TURNS\nIn Initiative Order (starting with the character at the top of the Initiative Order), each character takes a Turn. This can include enemies who were not present before the combat began and have since entered the fight. During his Turn, each character can perform one or more Actions as described earlier. These Actions are resolved before the next character in the Initiative Order takes his Turn.\n\nMaking a sneaky, successful Silent Move skill Test may prevent enemies from perceiving a character's Initiative Order position, as if players have positioned some characters for an ambush. Again, the GM can oppose this with an Awareness Test from the intended victims. This would mask the detection of all likely sources of discovery ranging from campfires to marksmanship.\n\nSTEP 5: ROUND ENDS\nWhen each character has taken a Turn, the Round is complete. Are there any lingering effects that specify a duration of \"until the end of the Round\"? If so, those effects now end. Has someone fled or is combat otherwise resolved? If not, go back to Step Four and begin a new Round.\n\nSTEP 6: REPEAT STEPS 4-5 AS NEEDED\nCombat continues over successive Rounds until the situation that triggered the switch to Structured Time is resolved or the GM decides that it's appropriate to return to Narrative Time.\n\nSurprised characters lose their Turns during the first Round. However, effects that would happen before their Turn (in Initiative Order) such as Bleeding still occur. Standard bonuses to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill are not applied during the Surprise Round (completely). A surprised character cannot perform their Turn until the Surprise Round is completed. A surprised character does not contribute to the Initiative Order until the beginning of the second Round, when the Surprise has dissipated and the combat proceeds normally.\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT MAPS (OPTIONAL)\nTo make combat more concrete with visual references to help participants visualize their surroundings and track their positions relative to threats and opportunities, sketching out a simple tactical map on paper works fine. Most people use a simple grid. Each square should be considered about one square meter for measuring distances on a Tactical Combat Map.\n\nEXAMPLE\nThe GM and his players are fighting aboard a Raider class vessel, opposing hostile deck crew and dangerous Mutants. There happen to be printed battle maps from a science fiction roleplaying game where 1 inch represents 2 meters of distance on a Tactical Combat Map. The players like using miniatures when playing the game, especially with starships scaled for wargaming. Alternately, using tokens to represent characters works as well. One square/tile can represent one square meter in-game or one interactable grid.\n\nWhile tactical combat maps are useful, many Rogue Trader GMs prefer to run a purely narrative style of game where roleplayers use rich narrative descriptions instead of grids and models. This requires greater cooperation between GM and players, but allows for greater freedom in detailing the events of a campaign. The GM may find that a blend of narrative and tactical combat allows players to visualize better, especially during scenes that are more tactical in nature than just roleplaying or banter."

      "text": "INITIATIVE\nInitiative determines the order in which participants in combat act. To determine Initiative, roll 1d10 and add the character's or NPC's Agility Bonus to the result. For example, if a character or NPC's Agility Bonus is 3, then their Initiative roll would be 1d10+3. To determine the Initiative for any NPCs and creatures present, for simplicity it is recommended that the GM make a single Initiative roll for groups of similar enemies. For example, all identical Mutants would act on the same initiative.\n\nEXAMPLE\nInquisitor Klauss and his Captain Sirko are about to face off against three Dark Eldar. They both roll their Initiative. Klauss has an Agility of 41, so his Agility Bonus is 4. Sirko has an Agility of 35, so his Agility Bonus is 3. Klauss rolls a 7 and adds his Agility Bonus of 4 for a total of 11. Sirko rolls a 2 and adds his Agility Bonus of 3 for a total of 5. The Dark Eldar all have an Agility of 50, giving them an Agility Bonus of 5. The GM rolls for all three Dark Eldar as a group and gets a 6, adding their Agility Bonus of 5 for a total of 11. Since Klauss and the Dark Eldar are tied, they compare Agility scores. The Dark Eldar go first with their Agility of 50 compared to Klauss's 41. The Initiative Order is Dark Eldar (11), Klauss (11), then Sirko (5).\n\nACTIONS\nThere are five types of Actions a character can perform on his Turn: Full Actions, Half Actions, Reactions, Free Actions, and Extended Actions. Each is detailed in the following sections.\n\nFull Actions\nA character can take one Full Action on his Turn during each Round. A Full Action requires a character's complete concentration and effort to accomplish. Examples of a Full Action:\n\nGrappling\nRunning an attack\n\nHalf Actions\nA character can take two different Half Actions on his Turn, or the same Half Action twice (with exceptions). Examples of Half Actions:\n\nStandard Attack\nAiming\n\nReactions\nReactions are special Actions that a character can take even when it is not his Turn. A character can only perform one Reaction per Round unless specified otherwise by a Talent or other special rule. Examples of Reactions:\n\nDodging\nParrying\n\nFree Actions\nA Free Action takes only a moment and requires no real effort. Free Actions may be performed in addition to any other Actions on a character's Turn. Examples of Free Actions:\n\nSpeaking a few words\nDropping an object\n\nExtended Actions\nAn Extended Action is a type of Action that takes longer than one Round to complete. Once a character commits to an Extended Action, he cannot perform any other Actions until the Extended Action is completed, abandoned, or interrupted. If a character performing an Extended Action is wounded, he must make a Willpower Test or the action is interrupted and he must start over. For example, repairing machinery in the middle of the fight, stopping to generate information from a portable cogitator, etc.\n\nEXAMPLE\nDrake decides to reload his pistol while in combat. In Rogue Trader, reloading a weapon counts as a Half Action. Drake still has one Half Action left in his Turn, so he draws his sword (a Free Action) and then charges towards his opponent (another Half Action). On his next Turn, Drake then decides to make a Full Attack with his sword (a Full Action), which does not leave him with enough actions to do anything else that Round (such as reloading his pistol again).\n\nTYPES OF ACTIONS\nCharacters can perform five types of Actions: Full Actions, Half Actions, Reactions, Free Actions, and Extended Actions.\n\nACTION SUBTYPES\nIn addition to having a type, each Action also has a subtype. Action subtypes don't actually do anything, but they help clarify what a character is doing. Keep in mind that these are all mutually exclusive. When using a melee attack, it is not also a Ballistic Attack."

For example, walking between firing a power sword should probably count as something more than a Free Action.\n\nUSING ACTIONS\nDuring his Turn in combat, a character may perform one Full Action, two Half Actions, or one Half Action and a combination of other actions (which is counted as a Full Action). A character may also perform any number of Free Actions with the agreement of the GM. It is important to note that, with the exception of Reactions, Actions can only be performed on a character's Turn during a Round. Most Actions are completed during the same Round they are started, but some Actions may take more than one Round to complete. Free Actions can be combined with any other action, and typically include such short verbal expressions as shouting warnings and calling for help. The Game Master decides how much a player character can say in a free action upon evaluating the situation. Most GMs will allow the utterance of a short phrase or warning. Note that a character can only enter one stance per Round."

      "text": "ACTION DESCRIPTIONS\nHere listed is a complete reference of all Actions found in Table 9-4: Structured Time Actions. These are the Actions which the attacker can build speed and momentum with and combine carefully. The attacker gains a +10 bonus to the Weapon Skill Test made at the end of the Action.\n\nAIM\nType: Half Action or Full Action\nSubtype: Concentration\nThe Active character takes careful aim to increase the chances that their next ranged attack will hit. When a character spends a Half Action to Aim, he grants a +10 bonus to the next Ballistic Skill Test made this Turn. If a character spends a Full Action to Aim, he grants a +20 bonus to the next Ballistic Skill Test made this Turn.\n\nDEFENSIVE STANCE\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Concentration\nThe character focuses on self-defense, making himself harder to hit in melee combat. He makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test. If successful, the character gains a +20 bonus to all Weapon Skill Tests to parry enemy attacks until the start of his next Turn. The character also loses if the character performs any Action other than a Reaction before making his attack. Additionally, characters in a Defensive Stance cannot use their Reaction and opponents suffer a -10 penalty to all melee and ranged attacks against them.\n\nALL OUT ATTACK\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Melee\nThe attacker makes a focused, all-out attack at the expense of his defenses. The character makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test, but cannot Dodge or Parry until the start of his next Turn. The delayed Half Action allows the character to perform a Standard Attack against the same opponent (or another target of his choice) when his Turn ends. This delayed Half Action cannot be Dodged.\n\nDELAY\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Miscellaneous\nThe character chooses to delay his actions until later. Any time after his Turn and before the start of his next Turn, the character can perform the delayed Half Action of his choice. If multiple characters attempt to perform delayed Half Actions at the same time, they must first make an Opposed Agility Test to determine who goes first. The character who attempts the delayed Half Action next receives a -10 penalty to the relevant Test.\n\nBRACE HEAVY WEAPON\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Miscellaneous\nThe active character braces a heavy or unwieldy ranged weapon to fire without incurring its normal penalties by taking a kneeling or prone position, or using a bipod or other brace. Until the active character's next Turn, he gains a +10 to his Ballistic Skill Test when firing this weapon. Some weapons gain a special benefit from bracing.\n\nEXAMPLE\nWhen Trader Quartus Bazzite Gravis uses his Ceres-pattern heavy bolter without bracing first, he would suffer a -30 to his Ballistic Skill Test. When he braces, this penalty reduces to -20. In addition, his weapon isn't prone to overheating as much (not depending on the type). Also, heavy weapons gain a -10, not -20, for being fired without bracing after being braced.\n\nCALLED SHOT\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Attack, Concentration\nThe active character carefully aims for a specific part of his target. The attacker declares a location to be hit (such as Head, Body, Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, or Right Leg). Then he makes a Hard (-20) Weapon Skill Test or Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test. If he succeeds, he hits the desired location of the attack and makes the attack roll as normal. Other hit locations are determined normally.\n\nCHARGE\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Melee, Movement\nThe character rushes forward to deliver a powerful melee attack. The target must be visible and within the active character's charge move (a Run action followed by a melee attack). The character makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test with a +10 bonus to the Test. If he succeeds with at least one degree of success, the target must make a Challenging (+0) Strength Test or be knocked down."

      "text": "FOCUS POWER\nType: Half, Full, or Extended Action (Varies)\nSubtype: Varies\nThe character attempts to flee from combat and get away from danger by moving quickly. Characters fleeing from combat may need to flee from multiple attackers or hazards and architecture. This action takes time and has a nature and subtype as specified in the power's effect description. When a character wishes to flee, he must perform one of the following actions:\n\nIf not engaged in melee combat, the character can perform the Run Action.\nIf engaged in melee with one or more opponents, the character must first break free by using the Disengage action, each of his opponents gets a Free Attack against him. Without making the Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test, each enemy in melee range may take a Free Standard Attack against him. These are made one at a time, in Initiative order. If the character survives these attacks, he may then perform the Run Action.\n\nFULL AUTO BURST\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Ranged\nThe active character unleashes a burst of fully automatic gunfire at his enemies. The attacker must be wielding a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this action. If the attacker is wielding multiple weapons, both capable of fully automatic fire, both with this action (see Two Weapon Fighting, page 246). The attacker makes a Challenging (+0) Ballistic Skill Test with a -10 penalty. While making this Test, the degrees of success are counted differently than normal. Instead of noting hits with degrees of success, the Active character rolls 1d5 and adds the result to his degrees of success to determine the number of separate hits inflicted in this manner (representing the spray of fully automatic gunfire). If the dice result is 9 or 10, then the weapon jams (see Weapon Jamming, page 228, for more details). Each degree of success allows one additional hit beyond the first. The attacker also adds one additional hit for each point of his Ballistic Skill Bonus. These additional hits may either be focused on the same target or spread among multiple targets within two meters of each other.\n\nDodging Auto-Fire and Area Effect Attacks\nDodging attacks such as those made with explosive grenades, area effect weapons, or fully automatic fire is especially difficult and dangerous. When Dodging an area effect weapon (such as a grenade) or full auto-fire, a successful Dodge Test allows the character to move to the edge of the effect area to avoid the worst of the blast. The character performing the test must have room to move (see The Attack, page 244). For auto-fire, the distance the character can move is equal to the character's Agility Bonus in meters. If the character would need to move further than this to get clear, he doesn't get the benefit of the Dodge. For Fully-Automatic and Semi-Automatic Bursts, each degree of success on the Dodge Test negates one hit.\n\nTABLE 9-5: MULTIPLE HITS\nAdditional hits | Location\n----------------|----------\nFirst | Body\nSecond | Same as First\nThird | Right Arm\nFourth | Left Arm\nAdditional | Body\n\nEXAMPLE\nGruntur Krug fires his auto-pistol on full auto at Joseph Haarlock. Krug makes a Full Auto Burst as a Full Action. Krug makes a Ballistic Skill Test with a -10 penalty (characteristic value 35). He rolls a 25 and succeeds. He determines the number of hits by rolling 1d5 (he rolls a 3) and adding that to his degrees of success (1) for a total of 4 hits.\n\nEXAMPLE\nJoseph Haarlock decides to Dodge the incoming fire. He makes a Dodge Test and succeeds with 2 degrees of success. This means that two of the hits are avoided. Krug's full-auto burst still scores 2 hits on Haarlock. Krug determines hit locations for these hits by rolling on Table 9-5. He rolls a Body for the first hit and a Right Arm for the second. Krug then calculates and deals damage to Haarlock for both hits.\n\nFEINT\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Attack, Melee\nThe character attempts to use stealth and combat training to trick and mislead an opponent. The active character makes an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If the active character wins, his next melee attack against that same target cannot be Parried or Dodged. Regardless of the outcome of the Test, against anything other than a counterattack, the active character can add +10 to all attacks for the rest of his Turn. Feinting is a Half Action, not a Full Action."

      "text": "Weapons with the Scatter special quality allow the character to choose a different type of his opponent into a Full-Auto Burst at Point Blank Range. The benefits from Scatter and Full-Auto Burst are calculated separately and both applied, if the GM allows it.\n\nEXAMPLE\nRamzez Frunt is firing his Shotgun at Point Blank Range. The weapon has the Scatter special quality, so he gets a +30 for firing at Point Blank Range, and an additional +10 for using the Scatter quality. However, he has braced the weapon to fire a Full-Auto Burst, so he suffers a -10 for firing a Full-Auto Burst. In total, Ramzez gets a +30 bonus to his Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nGRAPPLE\nType: Half or Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Melee\nGrappling is when a character takes another character using only his hands, arms, legs, etc. The character performing the Grapple declares a Grapple Attack and makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test. If he succeeds, he has established a Grapple and becomes the controller of the Grapple; the first target becomes the Grappled target. A Grapple can be maintained across multiple Turns. On subsequent Turns, the Active character may continue the Grapple. As part of the penalty for being Grappled, the target can choose only the following Grappled Target Options:\n\nGrappled Target Options\nThe Active character is a target of the Grapple. As part of the penalty for being Grappled, he can choose only from the following Grappled Target Options:\n\nBreak Free: The Grappled target can attempt to break out of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength Test with the Active character controlling the Grapple. This Test can benefit from Assistance if the Active character controlling the Grapple has Assistance. If the target succeeds with the most degrees of success, he breaks free of the Grapple and may immediately perform any Half Action of his choice.\n\nSlip Free: The Grappled target can attempt to wriggle out of the Grapple by making a Challenging (+0) Contortionist Skill Test. If he succeeds, the Grapple immediately ends. After that, he may then choose one of the following Controller Grapple Options.\n\nController Grapple Options\nTake Control: The Grappled target can attempt to take control by making an Opposed Strength Test with the Grappling opponent. This test can benefit from Assistance. If successful, the Grappled target becomes the controller of the Grapple and his opponent becomes the Grappled target. The Active character can then immediately perform one of the Controller Grapple Options.\n\nDamage Opponent: The controller of the Grapple can attempt to damage his opponent by making an Opposed Strength Test. This action can benefit from certain Talents and Traits. If successful, the controller of the Grapple deals his unarmed damage to his opponent, who may then immediately perform any other Half Actions allowed by the Opposed Strength Test, including winning the Grapple.\n\nEXAMPLE\nRamzez has successfully Grappled a cultist. After winning the Opposed Weapon Skill Test in the Initiative Order, he has become the controller of the Grapple. Ramzez uses his Action to throw the cultist to the Ground by making an Opposed Strength Test. This Action can benefit from Assistance, but no assistance is currently available. If successful, the Grappled opponent becomes prone.\n\nPush Opponent: The controller of the Grapple can attempt to push his Grappled opponent away from or toward him by making an Opposed Strength Test which can benefit from Assistance. If the Active character succeeds, his opponent can be moved one meter in the direction of his choice. For each additional degree of success on the Opposed Test, the opponent can be pushed another meter in that same direction. The effects of this uses the Opposed Test rules. If the character's Half Move distance is 3, and the opponent is pushed a distance of 4 meters or more as a result of the Push, the opponent must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall prone. For the controller of the Grapple to move with his Grappled opponent, he must use his Half Move Action in the same direction as the push in order to maintain the Grapple."

      "text": "Size Differences\nParticipants in a Grapple who are larger than humans (see Size, page 249) may add a Size Factor difference (categories) to their Opposed Strength Test in the Grapple.\n\nEXAMPLE\nA Trollish Beast (Size Hulking) has Grappled a Human (Size Average). The difference in Size is two categories (Average to Large to Hulking), so the Trollish Beast gains a +20 bonus to its Opposed Strength Test to maintain or escape the Grapple.\n\nKNOCK-DOWN\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Attack, Melee\nThe attacker smashes his opponent in the hopes of knocking him down. The active character makes an Opposed Strength Test with his target. If the Active character wins, the target is knocked prone and must use a Stand Half Action to get back up. For every 2 more degrees of success the active character achieves, the target suffers 1d5+SB damage.\n\nEXAMPLE\nJago the Navigator attempts to knock down a ship rating. They make an Opposed Strength Test and Jago succeeds with 3 degrees of success. The rating is knocked prone and also takes 1d5+SB damage. If the attacker spent a Half Action to aim before performing the Knock-Down Action, all benefits of the Aim Action are lost.\n\nGUARDED ATTACK\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Concentration, Melee\nRaising the weapon to a position of defense, the character performs an attack while maintaining a defensive posture. The active character makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test. After the Action is resolved, the opponent suffers a -20 modifier to his next Weapon Skill Test against the Active character.\n\nMANOEUVRE\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Miscellaneous\nThe active character can spend a Full Action to move a character, an opponent, or some other obstacle (such as a wall), etc.\n\nJUMP OR LEAP\nType: Half or Full Action\nSubtype: Movement\nThe Active character can spend a Half Action to jump or leap horizontally up to the number of meters equal to his Agility Bonus. As a Full Action, he can leap twice that distance. During this Movement Action, the character can engage each opponent in melee. When an Active character ends within Melee Attack Range of another character, those characters are considered to be engaged in melee. An opponent may engage a fleeing character with a Disengage Action and that opponent may make a Free Attack against the Active character.\n\nMULTIPLE ATTACKS\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack\nThis action allows the Active character to make more than one attack. A character requires the Lightning Attack Talent, Twin Weapon Wielder Talent, or must be using a secondary hand weapon. See Two Weapon Fighting, page 246.\n\nSTATUS CONDITIONS\nDuring combat, characters in Rogue Trader often suffer abnormal status conditions. Here's a brief overview of some common conditions:\n\nHelpless (See page 249): Helpless characters can take no actions and are considered Prone.\n\nPinned (See page 249): Pinned characters are reduced to Half Actions (when certain conditions are met). Pinned characters can perform a Half Action with a -20 modifier in place of a Full Action. A character becomes Unpinned when the situation that caused him to become Pinned is resolved (destruction, victory, etc.).\n\nStunned (See page 249): Stunned characters can take no actions for a duration of Rounds equal to their Stunned Value (usually 1). Stunned characters automatically fail all Reactions and cannot perform any Actions. Stunned characters also cannot use a Fate Point to remove this condition.\n\nUnaware (See page 249): Unaware characters cannot perform Reactions until they become Aware. An Unaware character may become Aware at the GM's discretion. Otherwise, the character remains Unaware until the start of his next Turn.\n\nOVERWATCH\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Concentration, Ranged\nThe active character waits to fire at a target as soon as it enters their line of fire or presents a targeting opportunity. When using Overwatch, the active character establishes a killzone, which is the general area and direction the Active character is covering (the GM arbitrates this). During the Round, if an enemy moves in the killzone, the Active character makes a Half Action Ranged Attack with a -20 penalty. This attack occurs when the enemy is at the most disadvantageous position."

      "text": "READY\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Miscellaneous\nThe Active character readies a weapon or other object that was previously holstered or stowed. The item can also be put away with this action (but note that simply dropping an item is a Free Action). A character can also use this action to retrieve a medi-pack, inject a combat drug, or some other kind of item. Generally, the Ready Action can be used to draw two different weapons.\n\nRELOAD\nType: Half, Full, or Extended Action\nSubtype: Miscellaneous\nThe character reloads his weapon. The time required to Reload an Action varies depending on the weapon. Chapter V: Armoury details how long it takes (Half Action, Full Action, or Extended Action for 1+ Rounds).\n\nRUN\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Movement\nThe active character covers a distance equal to his Run movement (see Table 9-3: Structured Time Movement). This taxes the character's stamina, but does not tire him with repeated use. Until the beginning of the character's next Turn, all attacks made against him suffer a -20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and Ballistic Skill Tests. However, the character cannot make any attacks himself during the Run Action.\n\nSEMI-AUTO BURST\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Ranged\nWith cold precision, the active character lays out a burst of semi-automatic gunfire at his enemies. The character with the higher Agility Bonus acts first. The attacker must be wielding an automatic weapon (or a semi-automatic weapon if the GM allows) to take this action. If the attacker and defender are locked in an Opposed Agility Test, any who tie and test again, and the character with the highest Agility Bonus acts first. The attacker makes a Challenging (+0) Ballistic Skill Test with a -10 penalty. Each degree of success on the Ballistic Skill Test allows the attacker to make one additional hit. These additional hits may either be focused on the same target or spread among multiple targets within two meters of each other. If the dice result is 94 to 00, it indicates the weapon has jammed (see Weapon Jamming, page 228). This does not include Free Actions, such as Overwatch, which occurs normally. Furthermore, only two degrees of success works here. The rules for Multiple Hit Locations are applied normally to targets within range of the Semi-Auto Burst. Extra hits are allocated against targets (up to a maximum of three) within the Semi-Auto Burst's range.\n\nPARRY\nType: Reaction\nSubtype: Defense, Melee\nIf the active character is wielding a melee weapon capable of making a parry, he may attempt to thwart an incoming Melee Attack. He makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test. If the Active character's Parry Test succeeds, the incoming attack is considered to have missed (even if the attacker rolled well). Any damage is ignored. Parrying requires the defender to be using a weapon capable of parrying. The defender can only Parry melee attacks and must be Aware of the attack. Parrying is a Free Action that requires a Reaction. Additionally, a character can only Parry one melee Attack with a single weapon per Round."

      "text": "EXAMPLE\nIf the opponent is unarmed or if the attacking weapon cannot Parry, Initiative Points are doubled. If the attacker's roll is higher than the initiative level of the character being parried, all damage is countered. If the amount of success is equal to the degree of success between the attacker and defender, no damage is dealt but the tie is broken in favor of the defender. The character being Parried may roll 1d10 and attempt to add his Weapon Skill bonus (52=+2) to counter the Parry.\n\nSUPPRESSING FIRE\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Ranged\nThe Active character unleashes a withering hail of firepower to force opponents to dive for cover. This is similar to a burst of fully automatic fire (see page 241). When Suppressing Fire is declared, the Active character establishes a kill zone (generally determined by the GM). The kill zone is approximately a 45 degree arch from the character and extends to Point Blank Range. Any extra hits are considered misses. If the Suppressing Fire is performed with a scatter weapon, the kill zone area can be increased in size. The character makes a Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test to determine if his spray of gunfire hits any characters within the kill zone. Any character within the kill zone is considered Pinned (see page 249) for the remainder of the Round. If the Ballistic Skill Test succeeds, the GM assigns one hit to a random character within the kill zone. Furthermore, all characters in the kill zone must make Hard (-20) Agility Tests to avoid being hit. For each character that fails, assign one hit to that character. Determine hit locations and damage using the Multiple Hits rules (see page 242). If the character also succeeded on this Ballistic Skill Test, any character Suppressed remains Pinned during the next Round as well. The suppressing fire may ignore cover up to 4 points of Armor Points.\n\nEXAMPLE\nRamzez Frunt is firing his plasma gun at a swarm of Mutants. He declares that he is using Suppressing Fire and the GM determines the kill zone. Frunt makes a Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test to determine if his spray of gunfire hits any of the targets within the kill zone. The Mutants are Pinned within the kill zone for the remainder of the Round and cannot move out of it. If Frunt's Ballistic Skill Test succeeds, the GM assigns one hit to a random Mutant within the kill zone. Furthermore, all Mutants in the kill zone must make Hard (-20) Agility Tests to avoid being hit. For each Mutant that fails, assign one hit to that Mutant. Determine hit locations and damage using the Multiple Hits rules.\n\nSTAND/MOUNT\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Movement\nThe Active character stands if he is Prone, or mounts or dismounts a vehicle.\n\nTACTICAL ADVANCE\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Concentration, Movement\nThe Active character moves from cover to cover in a tactical position at half his Movement distance. For the duration of the move, he is considered to benefit from the Cover rules even when not actually behind cover.\n\nSTANDARD ATTACK\nType: Half Action\nSubtype: Attack (Melee or Ranged)\nThe active character makes either one melee attack by testing Weapon Skill, or one ranged attack by testing Ballistic Skill. The attacking character Wounds his opponent, inflicting damage.\n\nUSE SKILL\nType: Half, Full, or Extended Action (Varies)\nSubtype: Concentration\nThe Active character makes a Skill Test, usually Awareness, Dodge, etc. The action type varies depending on the skill and the circumstances.\n\nSTUN\nType: Full Action\nSubtype: Attack, Melee\nIf the active character is unarmed or armed with a melee weapon, he may attempt to stun his opponent with a blow to the head. The attacker makes a Hard (-20) Weapon Skill Test. If he succeeds, the attacker rolls 1d10 and adds the attacker's Strength Bonus. The target rolls 1d10 and adds his Toughness Bonus. If the attacker's total is higher, the target becomes Stunned (see page 249)."

      "text": "OTHER ACTIONS\nEXAMPLE\nIf a player wants to do something not covered by the Actions presented here, the GM should make a judgement about how long a certain task would take to perform (e.g., if Lord Titus Greer is trying to pull something from his belt and aim it, the GM might declare that this is a Half Action). Certain Actions should also be conducted with a Skill Test or Opposed Test as determined by the GM.\n\nSome Actions might only take a few seconds, which could mean a Free Action (after a hefty penalty for risk). For example, switching the fire rate on a weapon could be accomplished with a Free Action (that has no penalty at all). Trying to communicate an idea to a friend or ally would also be a Free Action (if such actions take little more than speaking a short phrase or two).\n\nTHE ATTACK\nAttacks are the most common action in combat. Whether armed with a lasgun, a power sword, or nothing but fists, the attack remains the most important part of the combat system. When making an attack, follow these steps:\n\nSTEP TWO: ATTACKER MAKES TEST\nFirst, the GM should verify that the attack is even possible. Characters must have a functioning weapon, line of sight to the target, etc. Next, an attack roll or characteristic test must be made. A character makes a Weapon Skill Test if he is performing a melee attack or a Ballistic Skill Test if he is performing a ranged attack. The modifier to the appropriate Characteristic should be applied based on the situation (refer to Dodge and Parry Reactions below). See the Spray and Pray sidebar for additional information on Attack Tests beyond the rules.\n\nEXAMPLE\nStep One: Apply Modifiers to Attacker's Characteristic before rolling percentile dice (e.g., -20)\nStep Two: Character makes Ballistic Skill Test\nStep Three: Attacker Determines Hit Location\nJoseph succeeds because his roll of 25 is less than his modified Ballistic Skill of 35. His attack hits.\nStep Four: Attacker Determines Damage\nRamzez rolls damage for his weapon.\nStep Five: Target Applies Damage\nDodge and Parry Reactions\n\nSTEP ONE: APPLY MODIFIERS TO ATTACKER'S CHARACTERISTIC\nWhen a melee attack is being made, the target may attempt to Dodge (see Page 250) or Parry (see Page 242) as a Reaction. If the Dodge or Parry succeeds, the melee attack is considered to have missed and no damage is inflicted. Ranged attacks require the attacker to make a Ballistic Skill Test, and usually only Dodge can be used to avoid damage (although many GMs allow Parry for certain situations).\n\nEXAMPLE\nFirst, using the Full Auto Burst Attack from page 242, the GM determines if the attacker's Ballistic Skill Test succeeds. Then, the target of the attack can attempt to Dodge. If the target makes a successful Dodge Test, he can avoid the attack.\n\nModifiers and Penalties\nAgility penalties do affect the Dodge skill. For example, if a character is using Heavy Armor, he takes certain penalties to his Agility rating. The GM should combine all modifiers together and apply the total to the appropriate Characteristic. No matter how many modifiers are combined, the maximum total penalty for any Test is -60 and the maximum total bonus is +60.\n\nSTEP THREE: ATTACKER DETERMINES HIT LOCATION\nUsing the percentile dice result from the Attacker's Weapon Skill Test or Ballistic Skill Test, change the order of the digits (e.g., a roll of 32 becomes 23, a roll of 57 becomes 75). Using this number, consult Table 9-6 to determine the hit location.\n\nTABLE 9-6: HIT LOCATIONS\nRoll | Location\n-----|----------\n01-10 | Head\n11-20 | Right Arm\n21-30 | Left Arm\n31-70 | Body\n71-85 | Right Leg\n86-00 | Left Leg"
    },
    {
      "pageIndex": 248,
      "text": "EXAMPLE\nThe Attacker has succeeded on his attack roll and now needs to determine where the attack will hit. With a successful Ballistic Skill Test of 43, we reverse the digits to get 34 as the hit location. Looking at the Hit Location table, this means that the target's Body is hit.\n\nSPRAY AND PRAY\nOne of the basic requirements for making an attack is that the attacker needs to see his target. With that in mind, someone might wonder why someone can't just blast away into the darkness with overwhelming firepower until something is hit? This is entirely possible and the GM should estimate the likely outcome, taking the various circumstances into consideration.\n\nFor example, the GM knows a hulking beast is down a corridor approximately 10 meters distant. Rather than random volleys of gunfire going in every direction, the GM should consider the possible outcomes.\n\nEXAMPLE\nRamzez makes a Ballistic Skill Test for his attack against the Ork with a roll of 95 (10 above his BS of 85). The attack misses, but the GM rules that a random part of the corridor takes the hit instead. The damage roll is 1d10+5 for this shot, and he rolls a 7 for a total of 12 damage. The corridor is only lightly armored, so it takes the entire damage. The Ork growls as bits of wall plaster rain down upon him.\n\nSTEP FIVE: TARGET APPLIES DAMAGE\nThis step to the attack is relatively simple. Take the damage roll total, subtract the Armor Points that protect the location hit by the attack. If this reduces the damage to zero or less, the attack has failed to penetrate and no damage is recorded. If damage remains after reduction, subtract it from the target's Wounds. If this reduces the target's Wounds to zero or less, the target falls and may be dying. He might also be dead if Critical Damage exceeds the target's Toughness Bonus (see Critical Damage, page 253, for more information).\n\nSTEP FOUR: ATTACKER DETERMINES DAMAGE\nAfter the hit location is determined, the attacker calculates and rolls for damage. Each weapon lists its damage die (most commonly 1d10), plus any damage bonus it provides. Also add the wielder's Strength Bonus (for melee weapons) or nothing (for ranged weapons). Then, roll the appropriate dice and add the modifiers to determine the final damage total. The final damage done by the attack roll (Damage) is equal to the dice roll, plus any modifiers for the weapon and the attacker's characteristics. The final amount is then applied to the target.\n\nEXAMPLE\nAfter hitting the Ork and learning that his attack will strike the chest, Graks determines what damage he will deal. Consulting the weapon tables, Graks sees that his weapon does 1d10+4 damage. The GM rolls a die for Graks and gets a 5. The total damage is 9 points. The target's Toughness and armor will reduce this damage. The Target has 3 points of Toughness Bonus and 2 points of Armor in his chest, for a total of 5 damage reduction. This reduces the damage to 4 points (9-5=4), meaning the target suffers 4 Wounds. The opponent still has 7 Wounds left.\n\nUNARMED COMBAT\nNot every fight in Rogue Trader demands bolters and power weapons. Sometimes conflicts can be settled the old-fashioned way, either with fists or unarmed fighting techniques (kicking, feet, and teeth). To make an unarmed attack against an opponent, the attacker makes a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test or, if his opponent is wielding a weapon, a Hard (-20) Weapon Skill Test. If the unarmed attack hits, it deals 1d5 Impact damage plus the attacker's Strength Bonus. Normal unarmed attacks include any Natural Weapon choice the attacker wants to use (Primitive Fist, etc.). In addition, a successful hit that inflicts damage equal to or greater than the target's Toughness Bonus when rolling damage (and not after reduction) also inflicts one level of Fatigue. During unarmed combat, if a natural 10 is rolled on the attack's damage roll and the attack hits, the attacker may roll an additional damage die (usually 1d5) and add it to the damage total. Furthermore, if a natural 10 is rolled on this additional damage roll also, the attacker may roll another damage roll and add that as well. This process theoretically continues as long as natural 10s are rolled on the attacker's damage rolls."

      "text": "Grappling and Two-Weapon Fighting\nWhen one character is wielding a weapon in each hand (whether melee or ranged), the character suffers a -20 Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill penalty for attacks made using his off-hand. When using an unarmed attack with each hand, the character may attempt to Grapple his opponent as if using a single limb to perform the Grapple (see page 243). While engaged in a Grapple, the controller of the Grapple cannot use Reactions, and he cannot defend against shooting attacks made against him. He is considered to be engaged in melee. Participants in a Grapple on hitting unarmed attacks against each other gain a +10 bonus to all such Tests. Participants in a Grapple may attempt to free themselves, as per the actions outlined on page 243. All participants in a Grapple suffer penalties to attacks made against each other.\n\nCOMBAT CIRCUMSTANCES\nRogue Trader offers rules for gripping drama and white-knuckle action, allowing combatants to control the pace and the potential fear element for each combat. From blowgun poisonings to civilization-crushing bombardments, combat should offer players a chance to feel the dangerous elements of their explorers' lives as they confront each section of the game world. Combat circumstances can be used to reflect the environment, the tactical skill, or the difference between the characters. Combat Circumstances can increase the difficulty of tasks by providing maluses or penalties, while other situations provide opportunities for characters to leverage good fortune and skill to kill their enemies. Explorers should make as much use of beneficial circumstances as possible (good plans, good positioning, and skilled use of any weapon at hand often make the difference between life and death).\n\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING\nMany an explorer has found that skillful use of a weapon held in each hand can often make the difference between life and death. Indeed, this practice has become an art form on many worlds, with dedicated martial arts focusing on teaching students how to maximize the effectiveness of two weapons in combination. They encounter these and other combinations very frequently in combat situations.\n\nTarget Selection\nThere are many situations covered in Rogue Trader where a character can make multiple attacks. For both melee and ranged attacks, the attacker must decide which target or targets will be struck. Remember, the GM has the final say about the difficulty of particular circumstances and events including combat (resulting in special penalties or bonuses for Explorer characters).\n\nOther rules include the following: a Twin-Weapon Fighter has the Ambidextrous Talent. When a character who has the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent is using a melee weapon and a pistol, he may attack with both whilst engaged in melee combat. If multiple enemies are engaged in melee combat, a character who has the Lightning Attack Talent may attack targets designated separately with each Attack as part of a Multiple Attack combat action (Full Action). There is no such thing as a reaction that can stop another character's turn.\n\nCOVER\nCover is one of the vital elements of surviving a firefight, and a good explorer knows that you go for your cover first and then draw the gun. Characters can seek cover to gain a defensive Ballistic Skill Test modifier. Characters are considered to be seeking cover by partially hiding behind terrain. However, there are cases where a ranged attack may still hit the cover rather than the target. It is up to the Explorer to decide which parts of his body to expose when he takes cover. For example, a character who hides behind crates might have his body and legs covered but expose his head and right arm. The attack would suffer a penalty to hit, but if the shot would hit the location covered by the cover (in effect, works the same as Armor), the cover works. The character making a Ballistic Skill check during this fire (if the cover works) damages the cover as determined by the GM.\n\nTABLE 9-7: COVER EXAMPLES\nCover Type | Bonus\n----------|------\nLight | -10\nStandard | -20\nHeavy | -30\n\nExamples of cover include:\nLight: Thin door, cogitator bank, market stall\nStandard: Bulkhead, furniture, foliage\nHeavy: Bunker, blast door, boulder, building"

If a character makes a Dodge Test when targeted by certain attacks, one can move out of the way, taking protection offered by nearby cover. Each successful hit against cover inflicts damage on that cover. The GM determines how much damage the cover can withstand before it is destroyed with each weapon doing its damage (Strength + Degrees of Success).\n\nEXAMPLE\nEngaged in Melee: When a character is adjacent to his target, he becomes engaged in melee. A character who is engaged in melee cannot use ranged attacks without penalty. Characters who use a successful Dodge Test can move out of melee combat (as long as they are not grappled) or flee.\n\nShooting into Melee Combat\nCharacters suffer a -20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests made to damage characters engaged in melee. If multiple characters are engaged in melee combat, the GM may opt to randomize the targets in a particular engagement hit with a miss with a ranged attack. The firer makes a Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test. If the firer fails, the shot may hit anyone within melee range (target determined randomly).\n\nStatus Conditions\nHelpless: Unable to act or defend\nPinned: -20 to Actions\nStunned: Unable to act\nUnaware: Unable to defend\n\nDARKNESS\nExtreme Range\nRogue Trader recognizes degrees of darkness from light to total absence of light. The penalty to the Ballistic Skill Test is dependent on the type of darkness and distance. Characters with the Dark Sight Trait are only affected by Complete Darkness. Ballistic Skill tests made in different levels of darkness suffer the following modifiers:\nLight Darkness/Shadow: Challenging (+0)\nDarkness: Hard (-20)\nComplete Darkness: Very Hard (-30)\n\nUnless a target is at Point Blank Range or the attacker has enhanced vision, the character cannot use Ballistic Skill to target an enemy that cannot be seen."

      "text": "STRAY SHOTS (OPTIONAL RULE)\nGunfights can reinforce the merciful nature of the Emperor's will. Sometimes when a ranged or thrown weapon misses its intended target, it's important to determine if the attack may have struck a different target. If the attacker failed his Ballistic Skill Test by a small margin (one or two points), the GM rolls 1d10 to determine where the attack instead hits another target within the following distances:\n\nRoll | Target distance\n-----|---------------\n1-5 | 1d5 meters\n6-7 | Another enemy in melee with the intended target\n8-9 | A random NPC bystander\n0 | The nearest friendly character\n\nThe GM might also determine that any time a Semi-Auto or Full Auto attack misses by rolling doubles, the attack also strikes a random bystander.\n\nFATIGUED\nFatigue can represent stress, exertion, or mental drain. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests suffer a -10 penalty for each level of Fatigue.\n\nFOG, MIST, SHADOW OR SMOKE\nBallistic Skill Tests made at targets concealed by fog, mist, shadow, or smoke are Hard (-20). While a character is obscured by fog, mist, shadow, or smoke, all Ballistic Skill Tests to hit him are Hard (-20) and Awareness Tests to locate him are Ordinary (+10).\n\nGANGING UP\nWhen a character and his allies engage enemies in melee, they gain an advantage if they outnumber their opponents two to one. Weapon Skill Tests made to hit gain a +10 bonus. If a group of characters outnumbers their opponents by more than two to one, their Weapon Skill Tests gain a +20 bonus.\n\nSCATTERING IN ZERO GRAVITY\nMoving dangerous objects in a Zero Gravity environment can become amazing and deadly. One way to determine exactly where the grenade goes after it bounces off the bulkhead is to determine scatter direction. Consult the scatter diagram for the result. Rolling 2d10 and comparing it to the scatter diagram shows where the grenade lands.\n\nHELPLESS TARGETS\nAttacks made against a helpless target automatically succeed. When rolling damage dice for such attacks, one of the dice rolled results in a 10, there is a chance of richochet.\n\nPINNING\nEven the most experienced Explorers know to keep their heads down when bolt shells start flying. Pinning represents a character's survival instinct telling him he needs to steel his nerves. When a character comes under Suppressive Fire (see page 246), the character must make a Pinning Test. This is a Willpower Test. On a success, the character acts normally, but on a failure, the character becomes Pinned.\n\nWhen Pinned, a character may only take Half Actions and suffers a -20 penalty to all Ballistic Skill Tests. A Pinned character may still use Reactions and defend himself while Pinned. A character may not leave cover while Pinned except to retreat (provided he can remain in cover while doing so). If there is no cover, a Pinned character must choose between going Prone or being exposed to the danger but able to move freely.\n\nHIGHER GROUND\nWhen wielding a melee weapon, characters gain an advantage over their opponents when standing at a higher elevation than the target. Characters on higher ground receive a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests made against these opponents. For example, standing on a table to attack an opponent on the floor would grant this bonus.\n\nLONG RANGE\nAttacks at a distance of more than double the normal Long Range for a weapon suffer a Difficult (-10) Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nFLANK\nMelee or ranged attacks made against the flank of a target receive a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests."

      "text": "STUNNED TARGETS\nAttacks against a Stunned target gain a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests. A Stunned character cannot use Reactions such as Dodge or Parry.\n\nWhen a character becomes Stunned, he/she remains Stunned for one Round (or longer, depending on the attack). While Stunned, a character cannot perform Actions or Reactions, nor can they benefit from any effects of Parrying. Once the Stunned condition wears off, the character can act normally. Stunned characters who are attacked in melee combat are particularly vulnerable because they cannot use Reactions.\n\nUNAWARE TARGETS\nDuring combat, some combatants don't realize that they are about to be attacked. A character who is Unaware (such as a target who has just been ambushed at the beginning of combat) cannot make Awareness or Dodge Tests. Characters in this situation cannot use Reactions such as Dodge or Parry. Unaware characters are under significant penalties for any Tests they make. The GM might also rule that Unaware characters are automatically hit by area effect weapons. Unaware targets are usually considered Helpless.\n\nPOINT BLANK RANGE\nWhen a character makes a ranged attack against a target that is very close (usually within three meters), the attacker receives a +10 bonus to his Ballistic Skill Test. Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets at Point Blank Range gain a +30 bonus to hit. The target, being more familiar with the environment, receives a -20 penalty to Dodge the attack if both characters are engaged in combat.\n\nWEAPON JAMS\nWith the capricious technology of the 41st Millennium, many ranged weapons have a small but real tendency to malfunction. Often, these malfunctions occur through overuse, lack of proper maintenance, or damage. When these malfunctions occur, weapons can be modified to reduce the likelihood of jamming. To clear a jammed weapon, the wielder must spend a Half Action performing emergency field repair.\n\nPRONE\nA character is considered Prone any time he is lying flat upon the ground (either face up or face down). Characters struck by weapons with the Concussive quality, or hit with certain weapons that can knock them down, can become Prone. A Prone character suffers a -10 penalty to all Weapon Skill Tests. However, a Prone target gains a +10 bonus to all Dodge Tests made to avoid ranged attacks which target him, though he suffers a -10 penalty to Dodge Tests made to avoid melee attacks. Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit a Prone target suffer a -10 penalty if the target is beyond Point Blank Range and a +10 bonus if the target is within Point Blank Range. If the attacker is also Prone, the penalties and bonuses cancel each other out. A Weapon Skill Test made to hit a Prone target gains a +10 bonus. Unless a character is engaged in a Grapple, he can stand to end the Prone condition as a Half Action.\n\nNote: Krak grenades and missiles are particularly dangerous in a ship. For such weapons, consult the Weapon Special Qualities (p.196).\n\nSHORT RANGE\nCertain weapons (particularly semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons) can fire almost continuously at Short Range, increasing the likelihood of hitting with a weapon. Ballistic Skill Tests made at targets within Short Range for Semi-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst, and Suppressing Fire Actions gain an Ordinary (+10) bonus.\n\nSIZE\nSize ratings can sometimes be significant when determining the success of Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests. For example, larger objects or creatures are usually easier to hit than smaller objects or creatures. The GM can use Table 9-9 to determine bonuses or penalties for attacks against targets much larger or smaller than human size. See Table 9-9 for information on size bonuses and determining hit locations. Table 9-9 lists these rules for reference.\n\nTABLE 9-9: TARGET SIZE MODIFIERS\nSize | Modifier | Examples\n-----|----------|----------\nMiniscule | -30 | Small rodents, insects\nTiny | -20 | Household pets\nSmall | -10 | Children, small aliens\nAverage | +0 | Humans, Eldar\nLarge | +10 | Space Marines, Orks\nEnormous | +20 | Gretchin, carrion eater\nMassive | +30 | Vehicles, drop pods"

      "text": "INJURY\n\nThe harsh and unforgiving consequences of making a mistake in the outer reaches of the galaxy often result in getting hurt. Explorers can face punishment from uncaring enemies, malfunctioning machinery, alien infection, and the cold, dark void. As a character makes his way across the stars, he must be especially cautious in dangerous combat situations.\n\nEXAMPLE\nTar has eight Wounds and a Toughness Bonus of 3. He is shot by a stub pistol, which does d10+3 damage. It strikes Tar's chest with a damage roll of 8, for a total of 11 damage points. Tar's armor absorbs 4 points (his Armor and his Toughness Bonus combined), leaving 7 points of damage. This reduces Tar's Wounds to 1. A common physical injury in Rogue Trader consists of being punched, shot, or otherwise physically damaged (see Damage and Wounds, page 173). However, in the rugged and unforgiving environments of the future, there are several types of conditions worth noting as well. These conditions include Special Damage such as the following: burning, bleeding, gravity, and madness. Different types of punishment and debilitation will befall characters in Rogue Trader. Characters can take damage, which represents how much physical abuse a character can take and remain conscious. After his Wounds reach zero, the character falls unconscious.\n\nWOUNDS\n\nDAMAGE TYPES\nDamage can be divided into five types: Energy (lasers), Explosive (grenades), Impact (clubs or fists), Rending (swords or claws), and Special (as specified). These damage types are primarily used to determine Critical Effects when a character has suffered enough damage. Each damage type is usually associated with a specific Critical Effect Table. Energy Damage is listed with the Energy Critical Effect Table, Impact Damage with the Impact Critical Effect, etc. Wounds are usually depleted, then once a character is reduced to 0 Wounds, the next injury results in Critical Damage.\n\nCRITICAL DAMAGE\nWhenever a character's Damage exceeds his Wounds (i.e., being reduced to 0 or less), they take Critical Damage. Each time a character suffers Critical Damage, he suffers the effects of the appropriate Critical Damage Table based on the hit body location (Arm, Body, Head, Leg) and the type of damage (Energy, Explosive, Impact, or Rending). Critical Effects may also be triggered by weapons with special qualities. When a character suffers Critical Damage, the amount of Critical Damage is equal to the amount by which the damage exceeded his remaining Wounds. This amount remains with the character until either healed naturally (difficult) or through medical attention (see page 264). Each part of a character's body tracks Critical Damage separately, and Critical Effects also have their own duration (including permanent). Critical Damage is cumulative; each time a character suffers Critical Damage to the same location, the amount is added to certain Critical Effects, applying the best (or the worst from the character's point of view) of each Critical Effect.\n\nARMOR SUMMARY\nArmor can help protect against Critical Damage. The Armor Points provided by armor count toward reducing incoming damage before it is applied. Critical Damage is determined after the source of the Damage struck the target. The armored location reduces the incoming Damage by an amount equal to the Armor Points usually provided. For example, if the source of incoming Damage struck the target in the Arm, the arm's Armor Points would reduce the amount of incoming Damage.\n\nSUDDEN DEATH CRITICAL DAMAGE (OPTIONAL RULE)\nTo speed up combat involving large numbers of enemies, the GM can adopt Sudden Death Critical Damage. With this method, instead of detailing each enemy's Critical Effect (and writing a lengthy description of the damage), any enemy character who reaches 0 Wounds or who takes Critical Damage that exceeds his Toughness Bonus, dies immediately. The typical effects of critical damage (blood, pain, etc.) still function normally. Sudden Death Critical Damage should not be used for Explorer characters (who instead take Critical Damage normally, using the full array of Critical Effect Tables).\n\nEXAMPLE\nA pirate has been hit with a bolter shot and takes damage that reduces his Wounds to 0 and does 5 points of Critical Damage. With a Toughness Bonus of 3, the pirate's Critical Damage exceeds his Toughness Bonus, and he dies immediately."

      "text": "TABLE 9-10: EFFECTS OF ZERO CHARACTERISTIC SCORES\nCharacteristic | Effect\n--------------|-------\nWeapon Skill | Cannot attack in melee\nBallistic Skill | Cannot attack with ranged weapons\nStrength | Cannot move without assistance\nToughness | Death\nAgility | Cannot move\nIntelligence | No cognition or reasoning\nPerception | Unaware of surroundings\nWillpower | No resistance to mental powers\nFellowship | Unable to interact socially\n\nFATIGUE\nFatigue represents physical exhaustion. Combat fatigue, sparring 12 rounds with bare fists, can all lead to a character taking an amount of non-fatal injury. A character can gain Fatigue from certain types of attacks, Critical Effects, and other sources of strain. Fatigue is measured by levels; each character can take a number of levels of Fatigue equal to his Toughness Bonus and still function normally. Should a character gain a level of Fatigue in excess of his Toughness Bonus, that character falls unconscious for 10+TB minutes; after which he awakens with Fatigue reduced by one level from maximum. Each level of Fatigue applies a -10 penalty to all Tests.\n\nEXAMPLE\nGrik has a Toughness Bonus of 3. He suffers one level of Fatigue from combat fatigue, another level from crossing a desert, and a third from a critical effect during combat (three levels of Fatigue in total). Since this does not exceed his Toughness Bonus of 3, Grik is fine but suffers a -30 penalty to all tests. After the stressful events, Grik lies down to sleep for eight hours. The GM gives him a Toughness Test to recover 1d5 Fatigue (he rolls 3). After eight hours of sleep, all of Grik's Fatigue is gone and he can make Characteristic Tests at full ability. Had Grik suffered 4 levels of Fatigue, it would exceed his Toughness Bonus and he would have fallen unconscious.\n\nREMOVING FATIGUE\nExplorers can remove amounts of Fatigue in a variety of ways. Getting rest, counting sleep or unconsciousness (but not psychic shock or being stunned), can remove Fatigue. Four hours of rest removes one level of Fatigue. Eight consecutive hours of sleep removes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The GM might also rule that certain drugs or special circumstances can remove Fatigue at a faster rate. Some Psychic Powers can also remove Fatigue.\n\nCHARACTERISTIC DAMAGE\nIn addition to Wounds and Critical Damage, characters can also suffer Characteristic Damage. This form of damage directly reduces a Characteristic's value and can affect the character's overall effectiveness. For example, a character who takes Intelligence Damage may find himself unable to comprehend his surroundings. Table 9-10 shows the effects of zero Characteristic Scores.\n\nREMOVING DAMAGE\nCharacters automatically remove Damage (both ordinary and Critical Damage) over time through natural healing. Medical attention and Talents can also restore Damage. Regardless of the method, the amount of Damage removed depends on the severity and this is fully explored in Healing (page 262).\n\nREMOVING CHARACTERISTIC DAMAGE\nUnless otherwise specified, Characteristic Damage recovers naturally. Characters recover one point of Characteristic Damage each day (24 hours). The GM may allow certain special medications to remove Characteristic Damage at a faster rate."

      "text": "CONDITIONS AND SPECIAL DAMAGE\n\nCommon injuries are far from the only forms of bodily harm that might befall those who venture into the unknown. Explorers who find themselves wounded may suffer from Burns, Loss of Limb or Loss of Head, broken bones, permanent amputation, and many other collective wounds.\n\nAMPUTATED LIMBS\nLosing parts of the body is a common event for enemies of character that lose body parts (except for the head, which almost certainly means death). An affected limb can be treated as follows:\n\nBLINDED\nA blind character automatically fails all Tests that rely on vision. He also suffers a -30 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and Ballistic Skill Tests. He also suffers a -20 penalty to Dodge Skill. A character with the Medicine Skill must make an adequate Difficult (-10) Medicine Test to treat the injury. Ordinary benefits of vision are lost until the healer makes a successful Test. Most Explorers would ordinarily benefit from augmetics. The Ministorium, or perhaps even agents of the Inquisition will tell them they don't need their eyes.\n\nAfter 1d10 days (whether or not the medic treats the character by removing the infection), the flesh heals. Assuming that the character can cope with the disability's effects (as listed above), he may attempt to function despite the condition.\n\nBLOOD LOSS\nBlood Loss is a Critical Effect that can result from Critical Damage. Characters suffering from Blood Loss have a 10% chance of dying every Round unless treated. If the suffering character remains conscious, they must attempt a Difficult (-10) Medicae Test each Round with the Bleeding condition. Should this continue for more than one Round, the character suffers a -20 penalty to all Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on movement. Whatever caused the Blood Loss, the injured character should attempt to staunch the bleeding instead. This requires a Hard (-20) Medicae Test. If the affected character doesn't have another character to help, he can attempt to staunch the bleeding while conscious.\n\nDEAFENED\nA deafened character cannot hear well enough to communicate with others. Until the character regains his hearing, the character automatically fails any Skill or Characteristic Test that relies on hearing. Apart from having trouble communicating with his fellow explorers, he no longer has a bonus to Initiative (Trust me, it's bad, plus it's a -20 penalty to all Perception Tests). A deafened character will have trouble detecting when enemies approach. The GM should consider this when determining if the character is unaware or surprised.\n\nFIRE\nAt the beginning of each Round after the first in which a character is set alight (or if he is hit by a weapon with the Flame special quality), the character suffers a Challenging (+0) Agility Test. On a failure, he takes 1d10 Energy Damage (with reduction from armor) and takes 1 level of Fatigue each Round. The fire strength increases by 1 for the purpose of determining future damage from these flames.\n\nA character fighting flames must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test at the beginning of each Round. On a success, he can act normally for that Round. On a failure, he must spend his action to briefly try to extinguish the flames himself by dropping prone and rolling. This requires a Hard (-20) Agility Test. Every character adjacent to the flames can also try to extinguish them by making a Hard (-20) Agility Test. On a success, the flames are extinguished."

      "text": "UNCONSCIOUSNESS\nWhen a character makes a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test at the beginning of his Turn each Round after falling unconscious (typically due to suffering Critical Damage, excessive Fatigue, or some other effect that caused his brief incapacitation), a successful Test means the character wakes up.\n\nThe GM can rule that an unconscious character remains unconscious for a longer duration depending on the effect that caused it. An unconscious character is completely unaware of his surroundings and cannot take any actions. An unconscious character is considered helpless and unaware (see page 248) unless woken earlier. If unconsciousness is due to having too many levels of Fatigue, the character recovers some of that Fatigue so that his Fatigue is equal to his Toughness Bonus.\n\nFALLING\nCharacters can fall off things for all manner of reasons. To determine damage from a fall, simply roll 1d10 and add 1 damage point per meter fallen. Use Table 9-4: Hit Locations to determine which part of the body hits the ground first. Armor offers protection for the purposes of determining Critical Effects. Should a character take damage after making a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test to see if a Critical Effect is triggered, the GM should consider which location absorbed the most damage.\n\nUSELESS LIMBS\nCertain Critical Effects indicate that a limb is permanently affected. A character with the Medicae Skill can attempt to determine if the injured character's condition needs assistance. Even if the detection is successful, the limb must be held in a cast or splint for 1d5+5 weeks while natural healing occurs. Should a Toughness Test fail, the limb requires more extensive help. A character with the Medicae Skill can succeed at a Difficult (-10) Medicae Test. Should this fail, the limb still requires 1d10 more Damage to the limb (ignoring the effects of armor). Should the limb already be amputated (see above), the character suffers blood loss and must be treated with a Routine (+20) Medicae Test to cauterize the wound.\n\nOnce this has been dealt with, the Chirurgeon must treat the amputated limb (see above).\n\nVACUUM\nThere is no fate more harsh to contemplate than vacuum exposure except suffocation. It is unfortunate that both could occur while exploring a derelict ship. A character exposed to vacuum without an environmental suit or void suit suffers a number of effects.\n\nA character can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to his Toughness Bonus. If a character cannot or does not hold his breath (such as when caught by surprise), the character begins to suffocate. A character can attempt to resist the effects of suffocation at the end of each Round by making a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. After a number of failed tests equal to his Toughness Bonus, the character falls unconscious for 10+TB minutes.\n\nIf exposed to vacuum without protection, at the start of his Turn each Round, a character takes 1d10+1 Explosive Damage from exposure to near absolute vacuum. If he succeeds on a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test, this damage is ignored. While in a vacuum, a character gains 1 level of Fatigue per Round from the effects of radiation. If a character loses his Toughness Bonus in rounds, he immediately falls unconscious for a number of minutes equal to twice his Toughness Bonus. If a character has not sought counter measures, it takes five Rounds for his blood to literally boil. After that, the character suffers an additional point of damage from Explosive Damage each Round. Armor does not reduce this damage. If caught in vacuum after being trapped in a pressurized area, a character gradually decompresses and may eventually suffer an embolism. A trapped character must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test at the end of this time (usually 1d10 Rounds in a pressurized area, then an equal number of Rounds to decompress). Failure indicates 1d10 Impact Damage, 1d5 levels of Fatigue, and the same amount of Critical Damage."

A character begins to feel the effects of suffocation after a number of minutes equal to his Toughness Bonus.\n\nHEAVILY DAMAGED\nA character is Heavily Damaged whenever he has taken more Critical Damage than twice his Toughness Bonus. A Heavily Damaged character only heals 1 point of Critical Damage per week through natural healing. Until a Heavily Damaged character receives medical attention, he cannot reduce any Critical Damage through natural healing. If a character takes Critical Damage equal to three times his Toughness Bonus, he becomes Heavily Damaged. A Heavily Damaged character who takes Critical Damage in excess of three times his Toughness Bonus inevitably dies.\n\nHEALING\nDuring the explorations of the galaxy, a character accumulates Damage. Rogue Trader has three different states: Lightly Damaged, Heavily Damaged, and Critically Damaged. Characters naturally recover from this Damage.\n\nEXAMPLE\nGrex has suffered 12 points of damage while fighting an Ork. With a Toughness of 39, Grex's Toughness Bonus is 3. Since 12 is beyond that (twice), Grex is now Heavily Damaged. Grex decides to seek immediate medical attention before he becomes Critically Damaged.\n\nLIGHTLY DAMAGED\nA character is considered Lightly Damaged when he has taken Damage equal to or less than his Toughness Bonus. A Lightly Damaged character removes 1 point of Damage per day through natural healing. A Lightly Damaged character regains an amount of Damage equal to his Toughness Bonus per week.\n\nEXAMPLE\nGrex has suffered 3 points of Damage (less than his Toughness Bonus of 3), so Grex is Lightly Damaged. He will naturally heal 1 point of Damage per day, or 3 points per week.\n\nCRITICALLY DAMAGED\nA character becomes Critically Damaged when the amount of Damage he has taken exceeds his Wounds. If a Critically Damaged character does not receive medical attention, he remains in a coma until medical attention can be provided.\n\nEXAMPLE\nGrex has suffered 18 points of Damage. With a Toughness Bonus of 3, Grex is now Critically Damaged. He must receive immediate medical attention or he will die.\n\nMEDICAL ATTENTION\nMedical attention is any Successful Action taken to cure a character from the application of drugs, Medicae Skill, or Psychic Powers. Medical attention can accelerate the removal of Damage, counter penalties, provide immediate benefits, aid Characteristic enhancement, and remove conditions.\n\nCYBERNETIC AND BIONIC REPLACEMENTS\nReplace lost limbs with bionic replacements. If a character loses a limb, perform a Surgery Skill Test to determine the benefits of cybernetic replacement. Both removing and attaching a cybernetic or bionic replacement is largely common. Chapter VI: Armoury contains statistics for various types of bionic and cybernetic enhancement."

      "text": "EXPLORATION\nExplorers will face many welcome and unwelcome challenges if they wish to succeed. ROGUE TRADER is a story-driven game that involves lot of exploration, excitement, and hopefully, the acquisition of profit.\n\nEXAMPLE\nWhen Nobleblood's vessel Mercator Anguis finds a Rak'Gol fighter craft drifting in space, the captain is anxious to make examination. Rather than mentioning every skill test required, the GM calls for an Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test across the boarding party. Both group and individuals can grab their moment of glory. As they progress further into the damaged vessel, the GM calls for a Challenging (+0) Navigation (Surface) Test. These tests should not replace roleplaying; instead they should enhance knowledge and narrative flow. The next few steps into the vessel require a Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test across multiple Explorers. The group presses forward, likely during their explorations to encounter surprising challenges.\n\nUSING EXPLORATION SKILLS\nExploration Skills can help achieve objectives, whether prowling the corridors of a derelict space hulk in search of treasure or scanning a planet's surface for rich mineral veins. Exploration Skills differ from Navigation in how the Exploration Skill Test is conducted. A Game Master might look at certain Skills in a certain way, considering them exploratory or situational.\n\nEXPLORATION CHALLENGES\nThe GM can often create scenarios where a character needs to look or seek with colleagues. When the group begins their exploration of a derelict ship or newly expanded region of space, as characters contribute to the success of the challenge, an Extended Test might be undertaken. Failing an Exploration Challenge means that the challenge is a failure and must be completed in a different way. When the explorers collectively use all of their Exploration Skills to succeed at completing a Challenge without assembling enough degrees of success to complete the challenge, Table 9-27: Exploration Challenges provides a barometer. The GM can adjudicate how difficult the challenge is to reduce the penalty which the players are likely to face.\n\nDuring an Exploration Challenge, participating characters can make Tests using Exploration Skills to assist. Failure does not mean the character can make no Test, instead their increased difficulty should become progressively harder. This allows the explorers to proceed. In certain incidents, the GM may rule that certain Skills could help return their ship to operations and safety. Alternatively, they could become temporarily stuck in a line, left with a choice between different dangerous environments where their usual skills may be considered unusual. The GM should eventually give multiple Tests, only if the group is really different. In other instances, the GM can decide if the Test is Exploration Skill Test.\n\nTABLE 9-27: EXPLORATION CHALLENGES\nA typical individual Exploration Skill Test is Challenging (+0), but this can change depending on the Challenge Complexity.\nDegrees of Success Required: The challenge's difficulty sets how many Exploration Skill Tests need to be successful. Local terrain can influence difficulty.\nWhen an individual Exploration Skill Test fails, the next Test increases in difficulty by one step. For example, failing a Challenging (+0) Test changes the difficulty to Difficult (-10).\nEach degree of failure on an individual Exploration Skill Test increases the difficulty for the next Test by one step."

Information gathering is pivotal to Exploration into the unknown. It's a dangerous business to gather intel in complex situations. An investigation technique might include conducting thorough examinations of individuals and tracking information. Each Test can delve into fantastical ramifications within a location. When using special contacts to uncover clues, this can make more sense in the location tools section.\n\nMany methods of investigation deal with history, ancient writings that could be completely untranslatable, considering contradictions in potential knowledge, incomprehensible transmitting of ancient artifacts. Examples of failed investigations: Uncovering the past of a failed expedition; ultimately keeping a historic log of what was done in certain locations; Where research was conducted.\n\nWhen conducting impromptu investigations, a character can determine what clues are adequate for their skillset. Exploration Skills differ from Investigation Skills in that Investigation Skill Tests are normally concerned with gathering specific reliable information through research such as special access. Players should consult Table 9-29: Reliability of Hastily Gathered Information for guidelines for adjusting the results of an Investigation Skill test. The difficulty of the test depends on how complex the investigation needed, which also determines how reliable the answer is likely to be. The GM should recommend what tools are appropriate for the circumstances.\n\nMOVEMENT\nMovement is one of the most basic actions a character performs. Motion of a character through the ship's corridors or around quarters typically doesn't require Tests. After an investigation has occurred, common halls and pathways don't have trouble or difficulties while aboard the investigating character's own ship (providing the path has been cleared). During a given period, the GM can determine how far a character travels. Movement is measured in four speeds: Half Move, Full Move, Charge, and Run.\n\nWhen investigating a dangerous environment, characters take the normal amount of time (one hour equals one hour). The number of Degrees of success indicates mobility and safety, adding a few hours ahead of what's planned. The routes quarters to the ship's areas near corridors are all customized to suit that game-style. While exploring how to exist with these difficulties, characters need to travel and Moving between different environments is also a worry for investigators.\n\nTABLE 9-29: RELIABILITY OF HASTILY GATHERED INFORMATION\nComplexity | 1 hour | 2 hours | 5 hours | 10 hours\n-----------|--------|---------|---------|--------\nFirst | Reliable | Results | Accurate | Accurate\nSecond | Unreliable | Reliable | Results | Accurate\nThird | Unreliable | Unreliable | Reliable | Results\nFourth | Empty | Unreliable | Unreliable | Confirms"

The character can move up to his Run rate each hour. While running, the character takes a level of Fatigue each hour and must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. For each failed test, the character takes another level of Fatigue. When running, characters can't perform Perception-based Tests. As with Hurrying (below), running grants a +10 bonus to Toughness Tests to resist Heat, but carries a -10 penalty to certain Tests. After multiple failed tests, a character takes another level of Fatigue.\n\nFORCED MARCHING\nPushing themselves becomes necessary when forced marching. Forced marching is when a character is moving at a Full Move rate plus their Agility Bonus. See Table 9-30: Structured Time Movement and Toughness Tests With Penalty Per Hour for more details. This should remain with a standard character whose environment doesn't hinder movement. A character using Narrative Time Movement uses the standard speeds detailed for the character's environment. A few examples of terrain or conditions hindering movement can be found in the sections below.\n\nMOVEMENT AND ENVIRONMENT\nWhen movement occurs, characters in Table 9-31: Narrative Time Movement can be affected by conditions which slow a character's movement. Obviously, crossing over a cliff, climbing steep hills, or slogging through a deep death world swamp is far more serious than strolling through the steel corridors of a orbital space station. Depending on the environment, characters move at different speeds. When moving through difficult terrain or treacherous environments like steep inclines, deep mud, dense vegetation, fog, thick underbrush, and similar difficult terrain, a character risks a fall to make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall prone. The difficulty modifier is based on terrain and how hurried the character is at the time of movement.\n\nTABLE 9-31: NARRATIVE TIME MOVEMENT\nCharacters moving at the Hurried rate for hours equal to his Toughness Bonus must make a Challenging (+0) Hourly Toughness Test or take a level of Fatigue. For each hour beyond this, the character makes a progressively more difficult Toughness Test as the cumulative effects of Fatigue manifest. After failing a Toughness Test, the character takes one level of Fatigue. After the third period, the character must make a Hard (-20) Toughness Test."

The ideal method is to use climbing equipment. The chance for success is divided into two categories: Simple climbs and Sheer surfaces.\n\nSIMPLE CLIMBS\nSimple climbs include fences, steep hills, knotted ropes and anything else that requires effort and concentration, but not specialized equipment or skill. A character with both hands and feet available can accomplish a Simple Climb. Provided the character's free and is not being distracted (such as being shot at), the character can climb at a Quick Climb rate. For a Simple Climb, the character moves at half his normal Climb rate. This rate is one meter per round, stretched to reach overhead ledges or similar footholds. For most Simple Climbs, the character moves at half Movement. The GM can adjust the difficulty of the test based on elements like a slippery surface or grabbing a ledge.\n\nSHEER SURFACES\nMany surfaces are beyond the means of ordinary characters to climb without specialized equipment (such as overhangs without handholds), exterior walls of buildings, etc. Such surfaces require the Climb Skill to climb successfully. Such a character must make a Climb Test. On success, the character ascends at the rate of one meter per Round. For each degree of success on the test, the character ascends an additional meter. On a failed test, the character falls from his starting position (see Falling, page 264).\n\nClimbing difficulty depends on what the character is climbing:\n\nClimbing rope: Challenging (+0)\nCliff face: Ordinary (+10)\nOuter climbing beam: Challenging (+0)\nGlass exterior: Difficult (-10)\nAbseiling: Difficult (-10)\n\nCharacters can also descend more quickly by abseiling. This requires some kind of rope or similar climbing equipment. The character must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test to descend at a rate of 10 metres per Round. On a failure, descent rate is only five meters per Round.\n\nJUMPING AND LEAPING\nJumping and Leaping commonly arise during a character's explorations when a character attempts to either jump as high or leap as far to scramble out of harm's way, to reach a distant roof, to control or escape the clutches of an adversary. Jumping is divided into two categories: vertical jumps (see page 268) and horizontal leaps.\n\nSTANDING VERTICAL JUMPS\nStanding Vertical Jump: A character can jump about half a meter straight up (measured from the ground to the highest point the character reaches). With a successful Challenging (+0) Strength Test, the character jumps a vertical height equal to his Strength Bonus (rounded down). For each degree of success, the character jumps an additional half meter. A character can safely jump down from a number of meters equal to twice his Agility Bonus with a successful Challenging (+0) Agility Test. If he succeeds, he lands on his feet and suffers no damage. A character can usually safely jump down from twice that so long as he is willing to end up prone.\n\nRUNNING VERTICAL JUMPS\nIf the character gets a running start (at least four meters in a straight line), he can jump higher at the end of his Run Action. With a Challenging (+0) Agility Test, the character jumps a vertical height equal to his Strength Bonus (rounded down). For each degree of success, the character jumps an additional half meter. On a failed test, the character falls. The height attained while jumping in meters equals his Strength Bonus in meters travelled (round up)."

      "text": "STANDING HORIZONTAL LEAPS\nStanding Horizontal Leap: A character must make a Difficult (-10) Agility Test to clear a distance in meters equal to his Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, the character clears an additional half his Strength Bonus. For each degree of failure on the test, reduce the distance by another half meter. The height attained while leaping in meters equals half the meters travelled (round up).\n\nRUNNING HORIZONTAL LEAPS\nRunning Horizontal Leap: A character must move at least two meters in a straight line before leaping. He then makes a Challenging (+0) Agility Test. Leaps are calculated based on the meter length for his Strength Bonus plus a half meter for each degree of success. After leaping with his Strength Bonus meters, a character becomes airborne for a number of meters equal to his Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, the character can add another meter. For each degree of failure on the test, reduce the distance by another half meter. The height attained while leaping in meters equals half the meters travelled (round up).\n\nSWIMMING AND NARRATIVE TIME\nFor prolonged swimming, a character can normally swim for hours equal to four times his Toughness Bonus before becoming fatigued. After that point, the character makes a Toughness Test with each hour with repeated difficulty.\n\nEXAMPLE\nWhen a character goes underwater and begins to suffocate (see page 264).\n\nDistances covered for each Difficult (-10) Agility Test for swimming are listed in Table 9-31: Narrative Time Movement. For swimming, the meters equals half his Strength Bonus for Agility Swimming. For each degree of success, add another half his Strength Bonus. For each degree of failure on the test, reduce the distance by another half meter. The height attained while swimming equals half the meters travelled (round up).\n\nSWIMMING\nSwimming with both hands free requires concentration. To make progress swimming through water, a character must succeed at a Challenging (+0) Swim Test. For each degree of success, the character covers an additional meter in that direction. On a failed test, the character makes no progress. On a failure by three degrees or more, the character suffers one level of Fatigue and might begin to drown. For each Round the character doesn't have air, he must hold his breath (see Suffocation on page 264) or he will begin to suffocate. While swimming underwater, a character is also encumbered by each item he carries. Swimming is conducted as a Full Round Action.\n\nCARRYING, LIFTING, AND PUSHING OBJECTS\nHow much weight a character can carry, lift, or push depends on their Strength Bonus. General guidelines for how much a Strength Bonus can lift and push are found in Chapter V: Armoury. This section discusses the penalties associated with carrying heavy loads.\n\nCARRYING WEIGHT\nCarrying Weight is how much he can comfortably move with, without suffering penalties to movement or Tests. This weight is approximately equal to his Strength Bonus x 5 kg.\n\nLIFTING WEIGHT\nLifting Weight is how much the character can pick up and hold. This is equal to his Carrying Weight x 2. If the load exceeds his Carrying Weight but below his Lifting Weight, the character can lift it with a Challenging (+0) Strength Test. Each degree of success on the Strength Test allows the character to lift the burden for a number of Rounds equal to his Strength Bonus (1d5+SB rounds). If the test is failed, the character suffers one level of Fatigue during each Round he attempts to hold the weight. To lift anything heavier, the character must make a Very Hard (-30) Strength Test, and suffers one level of Fatigue during each Round he attempts to hold the weight. An explorer can only lift successfully very large weights if he has aid."

      "text": "TABLE 9-33: CARRYING, LIFTING, PUSHING WEIGHTS\nThis modified Table 9-31: Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Weights shows how much a character makes a Challenging (+0) Strength Test. A successful test means that the object dies a number of metres equal to his Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, the character pushes the object a number of meters equal to his Strength Bonus. For each degree of failure on the test, reduce the distance by another half meter. The height attained while throwing an object is usually one-third the meters travelled (round down).\n\nCarrying Weight | Lifting Weight | Pushing Weight\n---------------|----------------|---------------\nSB x 5 kg | SB x 10 kg | SB x 15 kg\n\nTHROWING OBJECTS\nWhen a character attempts to throw a small object weighing up to twice his Lifting Weight, he can throw the object a number of meters equal to three times his Strength Bonus. If the object hits a hard surface, each 3 meters fallen causes 1d5 damage. For any object that weighs more than double his Lifting Weight, the character must make a Hard (-20) Strength Test. Also, a character cannot throw an object that weighs more than triple his Lifting Weight.\n\nThrowing Weapons: Weapons, such as throwing knives, frag grenades, etc., are treated like other improvised weapons. Add the throwing character's Strength Bonus to the damage. Also, when throwing a dedicated throwing weapon, the character makes a Ballistic Skill Test. To throw an object that is not a proper weapon, the character makes a Strength Test.\n\nLIGHTING\nMany adventures take place in the context of night, the shadows' depth, the dark hold, or the oppressive darkness beyond the reach of plasma torches. Through depth and distance, for these reasons, light is of paramount importance when exploring the old places of the galaxy. Visual acuity depends on the amount of light available, ranging from bright sunlight to being within the radius of a chem-lamp to complete darkness. Shadow conditions mean the character is within partial illumination, while darkness means illumination beyond the normal range of Light, or Darkness, naturally occurring brightness of light. Utter darkness makes the obvious difficult.\n\nShadow Depth: Characters may move through areas of Shadow at their full movement capabilities.\n\nDarkness: Characters attempting to move through areas of Darkness are only permitted to move at half their Movement rate.\n\nPUSHING WEIGHT\nPushing Weight represents how much weight the character can shove across the ground. To push an object, the character makes a Challenging (+0) Strength Test. Each degree of success on the Strength Test allows the character to push the object a number of meters equal to his Strength Bonus. If the test is failed, the character can only move the object a number of meters equal to half his Strength Bonus (round up). Pushing an object across difficult terrain requires a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test for each move action.\n\nBright Light: Full natural light, equivalent to being outside on a bright day.\n\nShadow and Darkness: Shadow is considered to be partial illumination, being the ability to detect movement, having limited information.\n\nENCUMBERED CHARACTERS\nCharacters carrying their full Carrying Weight have no movement limitation. Encumbered characters carrying a load exceeding their Carrying Weight but not exceeding their Lifting Weight are considered Encumbered. An Encumbered character must move at a penalty and move duration. Unless the character makes a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test, the character takes one level of Fatigue for the duration of movement, and suffers a -20 penalty to Agility-related Tests for the Move action. For the effects of lighting, a character attempting to move through areas of Shadow means Challenging (+0) Perception Test. For moving through areas of Darkness, refer to page 247, and for shooting in darkness, refer to page 248, concerning target acquisition while firing through darkness.\n\nFLYING\nThis section describes rules for flying creatures and those with technology that grants flight capability."

      "text": "ALTITUDE\nAltitude affects combat in a variety of ways. If the aerial target meters above a typical Earth-like planet can be measured and, at the GM's discretion, affects: Hovering, Low Altitude, and High Altitude Flying.\n\nTo change altitude (up or down) during Movement requires one Move Action, and flying creatures may change altitude by one step (from Low Altitude to either Hovering Altitude or High Altitude) by performing this Move Action.\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF GRAVITY\nAlthough many worlds of the Imperium are similar to Earth in gravity, characters may find themselves exploring High Gravity or Low Gravity worlds. These environments affect how characters function in a variety of ways.\n\nHovering Altitude\nHovering occurs when a flying creature stays in one position above the ground but within melee attack range of ground-based attackers. A character at hovering altitude is capable of attacking both ground-based characters and airborne attackers. When determining Initiative and movement, hovering creatures add four to the total of their Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining Initiative.\n\nLow Gravity Worlds\nOn Low Gravity worlds, characters increase their Agility Bonus by two for the purposes of determining movement and Initiative. Additionally, characters add four to the total of their Strength Bonus for the purposes of determining how much weight they can carry, lift, and push. Objects thrown in Low Gravity travel twice as far. Characters also suffer a -10 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests due to the unfamiliar targeting conditions and their inexperience with firing weapons in Low Gravity.\n\nLow Altitude\nLow altitude indicates that a creature is flying at a height that is beyond the melee range of other creatures but still within range of ranged attacks from such creatures. A flier at Low Altitude gains a +10 bonus to all Dodge Tests made to avoid attacks from ground-based characters.\n\nHigh Gravity Worlds\nOn worlds with High Gravity, characters decrease their Agility by 2 Characteristic Points (to a minimum of 1) for the purposes of determining movement and Initiative. Additionally, characters subtract two from the total of their Strength Bonus to a minimum of 1 for the purposes of determining how much weight they can carry, lift, and push. Objects thrown in High Gravity travel only half as far as they would on a normal world.\n\nHigh Altitude\nWhen a creature is flying at High Altitude, it is far above the ground beyond the range of all attacks except for special ranged attacks from weapons with the appropriate range. High Altitude fliers can only attack or be attacked by other High Altitude fliers while at this altitude. High Gravity is also considered Difficult Terrain, meaning a character attempting to move needs to succeed at a Hard (-20) Agility Test or fall prone. Additionally, characters attempting to move at more than a Half Move action suffer a -20 penalty to all Ballistic Skill Tests.\n\nZero Gravity\nExplorers are most likely to encounter zero gravity conditions in either outer space or in a location with serious technological failure. Moving in zero gravity is considered Difficult Terrain, meaning a character attempting to move needs to succeed at a Hard (-20) Agility Test or continue to float in place. Additionally, a character beginning a Move Action must succeed at a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or be reduced to a Half Move for that Turn.\n\nFLYING MOVEMENT\nFlying creatures or characters with a flight capability function in a similar manner to more conventional movement types. While flying or hovering, movement actions like the Half Move, Charge, and Run are valid Actions. A flying creature maintaining flight can also perform any Movement actions as normal. If a flying creature suddenly stops flying (by being shot down for example), it immediately falls and suffers damage from the fall."

      "text": "PROFIT FACTOR\nProfit Factor should represent not only a thing; it is rather a combination of all the aspects of wealth and power the Explorers command. This means that Profit Factor is not a numerical amount for their coffers, their wealth, or their political reach. Instead, Profit Factor would be hailed as Lord-equal, meaning their complex web of loans, bribes, and merchant societies means that Profit Factor does what it does best. When the Profit Factor of the Rogue Trader rises, it increases his dominion within the Imperium.\n\nIn direction, Profit Factor is the most common use of Traders' wealth. Indeed, acquisition of equipment and luxuries—stretching across the character's acquisitions—is the primary use of Profit Factor. Explorers may acquire and maintain ships, transport fleets, and rights they may touch dozens of worlds and shape the face of their civilizations, transforming entire systems.\n\nWhile wealth, influence, Profit Factor can be transferred from the Explorers to others within Imperial society, it also enforces bonds of loyalty among the thousands of light years of holdings, and the wealth and power that only a Rogue Trader gains from Profit Factor allows the Explorers to bring influence to anything the Explorers are doing.\n\nSTARTING PROFIT FACTOR\nProfit Factor is unique to the PCs. Profit Factor is an amount generated using Table 1-5: Starting Profit Factor and ship Points (page 111) plus any additional bonus modifiers obtained during character creation. Beyond personal power, Profit Factor is placed at the level which allows them to retain certain specific influence with Imperial planetary nobles or Rogue Trader Ordinates. Many may match the amount of power with a minor Inquisitor, an Imperial world Ministorum sect.\n\nTable 9-34: PROFIT AND POWER\nProvides examples of profit Factor and corresponding power within the Imperium.\n\nGAINING AND LOSING PROFIT FACTOR\nProfit Factor can rise and fall with Fame, Endeavours, and Misfortune. Gain is usually a bonus that the GM gives to Explorers as reward for their actions when they have done well in undertakings by the PC involving such tasks as trading well and bringing wealth to richer individuals. Most Powerful: Guild, Industrially Built, Adepta, Familiar, Power, Falstaff, Falderus.\n\nLosses: Rogue Trader ventures will inescapably lose Profit Factor when operating in substantial risk, significantly decreased when Explorers' wealth and power is too great to be contained. The hierarchy of Imperial Organizations (page 281) lists the merchant class corresponding to which Profit Factor is decreased.\n\nTransfer: Misfortunes, Profit Factor can be mentally expanded when it has been transferred to wealth and power to too great a magnitude.

      "text": "ACQUISITION\nACQUISITION AS PLOT DEVICE\nA failed Acquisition Test does not necessarily mean that the wealth of the Explorers is completely gone. \"We are the lords of the void, shaping the fate of worlds\" goes an old saying within the trade dynasties. The GM can fold such events into the plot. Perhaps Grand Patriarch Gorlov Idok the Fell (all NPCs he deems the Rogue Trader acquires) has just been bought, and they received what they believed was genuine. However, Zenith discovers that the real merchandise has been stolen. At the heart of the criminal underworld, the GM may require the Explorer to make an Acquisition Test for items that the Explorers have the wealth to pay for, depending on the item's Availability, Craftsmanship, Size, etc. See page 132 for more details.\n\nEXAMPLE\nWealthface Acolyte perhaps from Militant Command of revenants \"The Wood Heroes\" looks for a unique pistol with Rites of 16. A d100 roll results in a FerTech Acquisitive Dar Haight belt weapon for his duty (Rarity: Common, Good Craftmanship (+0) since it is not a common-use item). The Explorer makes a Profit Factor Acquisition Test. His Profit Factor is 40, and he rolls a 36. Success means that he finds exactly what he was looking for and otherwise gets the Ferris duty from Joralf, the World broker.\n\nACQUISITION TESTS\nWhen an Explorer attempts to acquire an item with a Rarity less than his Profit Factor, the Explorer makes a Challenging (+0) Profit Factor Test (d100). This roll is modified depending on Availability, Craftsmanship, Scale, or other modifiers of the acquisition in question. If the modified roll is equal to or less than his Profit Factor, the Explorer succeeds the Acquisition Test and acquires the item. If the roll is beyond his means for the item being sought, then he failed the test and cannot acquire the item. Multiple failed Acquisition Tests may indicate that the Explorer's wealth is stretched beyond his means for the time being (or possibly for good).\n\nEXAMPLE\nAvailability of the item is found in various chapters of Armoury. Craftmanship Scale, etc. The weapon's Availability Modifier is first determined (Common +10), modified for Craftsmanship of the first selector (Good +0) since it is a secondary item (has a higher Availability). Requiring a total Availability Modifier of +10.\n\nMATTER OF SCALE\nSome items are tremendous, huge, or larger than a human. Human Acquisition Modifiers bonuses and penalties depend upon Scale categories. As Scale increases, Acquisition gets harder or easier accordingly.\n\nEXAMPLE\nWhen dealing with Scale categories, Matter of Scale can be used as a guide."

      "text": "AUTOMATIC SUCCESS AND FAILURE\nTABLE 9-35: ACQUISITION MODIFIERS\nWhen a character attempts to acquire an item out of the reach of others, their dynasty Factor Talent adds following bonuses to the Explorer's Acquisition Test even if success is guaranteed. If the Profit Factor exceeds the Availability of the item by 30 or more points, the test is automatically passed. Definition: If a Profit Factor is lower than the Availability of an item by 30 or more points, the test is automatically failed.\n\nEXAMPLE\nVerleith Fourteen Herenet wants to acquire a Toran'Ire Maat'mbar combat knife? While the knife is rated as Plentiful (+30), its craftsmanship is Rare (-10). Realm of the weapon itself (Ork Noggin Tools) is an item with nigh-impossible human acquisition. Ward has an Acquisition Test Modifier of -20, meaning his Profit Factor of 45 would require a 25 or lower to acquire it.\n\nAvailability | Definition | Modifier\n------------|------------|--------\nUbiquitous | Most common items | +30\nAbundant | Standard equipment | +20\nPlentiful | Typical Clothing | +10\nCommon | Standard weapon | +0\nAverage | Minor exotic items | -10\nScarce | Rare commodities | -20\nRare | Minor Rare | -30\nVery Rare | Major Rare | -40\nExtremely Rare | Mythical class | -50\nNear Unique | Unique known | -60\nUnique | One of a kind | -70\n\nACQUISITION AND STARTING CHARACTERS\nWhen a player creates a character, most Essential equipment that he reasonably requires, as per character creation rules. Starting characters may therefore follow these guidelines:\n\nFREQUENCY OF ACQUISITION\nThe frequency with which an Acquisition Test may be made to acquire goods is determined by the GM reflecting jurisprudence across corresponding Mercantile districts, dealerships, weapon training areas with local tradesmen, and so forth. The GM usually allows one such jaunt per running session for important acquisitions. However, such acquisitions may require the completion of certain ritual amounts of time or passing specific seller or time value of travelling certain market areas.\n\nEXAMPLE\nUNSCRUPULOUS TRADERS\nLord Novarion's Profit commander's Acquisition Modifiers came that the Kaeran is trying to increase. The GM decides that before the Explorers attempt their Default Pump Acquisition Test for Lord's market items making them challenge for wealth of Stelliros on multiple vessels, Clan of Hurlin Inciana frame of status within the armed forces of the main Meati doing futuro. He is dazed by the deal, insistence and resonance to rise to the price of each Mercantile transaction at a -6 rarity. On the surface, meaning the total Acquisition Modifier between +10 and -30, the GM rules that this is unusual, making the Trader's efforts against rolling a 1d10 and adding -20. When rolling a Trader makes the +4 Acquisition Test new bonus, the result is 17. Since Profit Factor is 60, the roll is successful."

      "text": "ACQUISITION LIMITS\nAs alluded to in the section on Acquisition, the GM should determine how many items an Explorer owns at any given time. Among the most important factors in this consideration is whether a particular item is disposable, reusable, or a one-time purchase. For example, drugs, food, and grenades are consumable items, requiring frequent replenishment.\n\nEXPENDABLES: AMMO, DRUGS, AND GRENADES\nMany items that an Explorer owns are considered disposable, one-time use goods. Once an Explorer has acquired such items through the use of the Acquisition Test, he then has a supply that he can reasonably be expected to use for quite a while. Explorers should be assumed to have as much of this material on hand as they wish (restricted only by carrying weight and common sense) when they leave their vessel.\n\nWhen Explorers want to acquire items in the midst of a scenario, Explorers must make an Acquisition Test for those goods if they are not already part of his gear.\n\nFor example, if an Explorer has purchased ammunition from a merchant but hasn't used up his initial supply, that can be assumed that he still has a full stock on hand whenever he needs it. This assumption also applies to many similar expendable items (drugs, grenades, etc.). Naturally, if an Explorer doesn't possess such an item, he must acquire it using the rules for Availability and Acquisition.\n\nThe Game Master can use the Rule of Three: The Explorer has three of each consumable item they are carrying. The GM can track which exactly which consumables they own.\n\nFor each of their weapons, the Explorers can carry three magazines or power cells. For each of their grenades, they can carry up to three grenades of each type. They can also carry up to three doses of each chosen drugs, which must be enough for the current situation. Until resupply becomes an issue, the GM should not bother to track these disposable items.\n\nEXAMPLE\nFinally, the Game Master can choose to determine if disposable items either run out or supply is disrupted, making resupply of vital weapons or drugs they might be using a particular adventure hook during gameplay. When such disruption in supply is likely, the Game Master can assist the Explorers to find shipments of much needed supplies using the rules for Availability and Acquisition.\n\nCOMMERCE AND ACQUISITION\nCommerce is important when dealing with the acquisition of equipment and good. An Explorer can use his Commerce Skill to gain a bonus to his Acquisition Test (see page 79). Usually, Commerce Skill is an important factor when dealing with Trade and Profit Factor. The Game Master may allow the Commerce Skill to increase his Profit Factor by a number of points equal to the degrees of success if the situation seems appropriate. When a servant sets about acquiring goods with Profit Factor, any Test made by the servant can use the highest Profit Factor in the group. Both increase and decrease of Profit Factor can affect an Acquisition immediately.\n\nEXAMPLE\nWhen dealing with unfriendly merchants, the Game Master may force them to make a Commerce Skill Test to Acquire Medicae supplies for the Under-hive of New Footfall World. After some interest from Trader Munte, the GM beckons for him to make a Commerce Test. The Explorer attempts to look and bargain for a good deal for his dynasty. He gains a +20 bonus to his Commerce Test since he is a DeMornay factor of his dynasty. By succeeding on his Commerce Test, he increases his Profit Factor by one point."

      "text": "ACQUISITION OF STARSHIP COMPONENTS\nFew things acquired and maintained by the Explorers have as much astronomical value as their void-ships. The plasma drives, macro-batteries, launch bays, and command bridges are of excellent craftsmanship.\n\nIf Explorers wish to acquire components and command a re-fit of their ship, the GM could work with the Acquisition Modifiers in detail using Availability fields for certain ship components. Availability for Starship Components can be found using table 9-36: Starship Component Acquisitions (also detailed in Chapter VII: Starships). However, for a quick Acquisition Test, the Game Master can factor in the Scale Acquisition Modifier of choice using the modifiers in Table 9-36: Starship Component Acquisitions. In rare cases, acquiring a system depends on selling another one.\n\nEXAMPLE\nTrisk is a Rogue Trader with a Profit Factor of 50. He wants to know if he can acquire a Strelov Warp Drive for his ship. Looking at page 205, he finds that the component has a Acquisition Modifier of -20 (Rare). Therefore, his Acquisition Test would be at a -20 penalty.\n\nUNUSUAL ACQUISITIONS\nChapter V: Armoury covers the Availability and Craftsmanship of equipment in general, while Chapter VII: Starships covers starships and related gear. However, these represent only a fraction of the potential items the Explorers may wish to acquire.\n\nTo aid the Game Master in determining what Acquisition Modifier to use when the modifiers aren't published, the GM can adjudicate based on implied value. For example, a ship's Hull Modifier is equal to its cost in Ship Points. Most lesser items functionally similar to things found in the High Born common rights must adjust for Scale. Refer to Ship Points in Chapter VII: Starships for an idea of the Rarity to assign. Some worlds may simply be extremely rich or poor in material that the Explorers are willing to acquire.\n\nAdditional modifiers to Acquisition Tests aside from those listed by Availability or Scale may apply. The GM should assign an acquisition's Availability based on Table 9-38: Acquisition Rarity. Rarity does not change in addition to Availability. An acquisition also has a level of Craftsmanship. Either Craftsmanship affects the acquisition like any other or the item has Best Craftsmanship.\n\nThe most important note is that building or retrofitting a starship can take an immense amount of time (often decades) and meticulous Craftsmanship to accomplish. The cost is usually staggering. Finally, the GM can assign Scale to the acquisition using Matter of Scale (see page 274) as a guide.\n\nTABLE 9-36: STARSHIP COMPONENT ACQUISITIONS\nComponent | Rarity\n----------|------\nPlasma Drive | Rare\nMacro-batteries | Scarce\nAugur Array | Common\nCommand Bridge | Scarce\nShields | Scarce\nLance Battery | Very Rare\nStructural Integrity Field | Common\n\nTABLE 9-37: ACQUISITION QUALITY\nCraftsmanship | Example\n--------------|--------\nPoor | Non-functioning, intermittent, or unreasonable\nCommon | On par with local region starship hull price\nGood | Functioning, minimal maintenance with professional upkeep\nBest | Professional, elegant designs with extraordinary quality; may be from famous shipwrights"

It's a faulty weapon produced by an obscure Forge World. His Guild Master (GM) rules that the quality is Poor Craftsmanship. When this occurs, it is treated with an Ubiquitous Availability Modifier of +30 since this applies to what the Explorer will then need to either purchase (after Profit Factor Test) or scatter the weapon into the void of space. The GM rules that should the Explorer fail his Profit Factor Test by exactly one point, then that means that although the Explorer cannot acquire the weapon, he can still keep his old Poor Craftsmanship weapon for now.\n\nEXAMPLE\nLord-Captain Miro, while searching for a Best Craftsmanship Bolt Pistol in Grand Triumph, makes a Profit Factor Test. Since the Test has an Acquisition Modifier of -30 (Rare) for the weapon and -20 for the Best Craftsmanship, for a total of -50, the GM rules that this is a Extremely Rare acquisition. Lord-Captain Miro's Profit Factor is 60, meaning he needs to roll a 10 or less to acquire the item.\n\nUPKEEP TESTS\nEven after the Explorers have spent their Profit Factor and acquired items, these acquisitions require upkeep due to use, wear, and maintenance. At certain intervals (see below), the GM can require the Explorers to make an UPKEEP Test for their acquisition to see if it becomes damaged or degraded in some way. An Upkeep Test is similar to an Acquisition Test in that it's Challenging (+0). If they fail the Test, then the Explorers must either:\n\n1. Discard the item (or it is damaged beyond repair)\n2. Make an Acquisition Test to replace or repair it\n3. Keep the item in a damaged state until the Explorer's Profit Factor increases\n\nWHEN TO MAKE AN UPKEEP TEST\nWhen Explorers take an acquisition into extreme environments or when equipment is damaged, worn out, expended, planetary warfare, sufficient bombardment from orbit, or sudden collapse of the supply chain, Upkeep Tests should be made. This allows Explorers to determine if their acquisition is still in working condition.\n\nThe GM should decide when the Explorers should make Upkeep Tests and what happens if the Test is failed. Ultimately, it is up to the GM to decide when the Explorers should make Upkeep Tests with their actions, though certain conditions might require care."

      "text": "UNIQUE AND NEAR UNIQUE SCALE\nExplorers can test to acquire a ship component whose Availability is either Unique or Near Unique. This often means taking exceptional steps and gathering holdings across their dynasty, especially for ship components. When fate plays into the Explorers' hands and it turns out that such items actually exist, in this case, the GM should grant bonuses for Scale, factoring in only the lowest applicable Availability constraints to the Acquisition Modifier.\n\nUltimately it is up to the GM to decide when the Explorers should make Upkeep Tests and how boom or bust economics returns the worlds back to standard.\n\nOpposed Test\n(see page 232): The GM can modify an Acquisition Test as an Opposed Test. The difficulty for this Opposed Test is determined by the actions of the Explorers' rivals. For every degree that the Explorers beat their opponents by in this Opposed Test, the Explorers gain a +10 bonus to their Acquisition Test. This bonus lasts until the end of the current adventure or scenario as the Explorers reap different benefits from their holdings. The GM can determine the most appropriate Skill Test for each side. For every degree their opponent beats them by, the Explorers suffer a -10 penalty to their Acquisition Test.\n\nAlternatively, the GM can use an Influence Test as one-off method of determining the result of free passage, bribing officials, making contacts, etc.\n\nINFLUENCE\n\"It does not matter who holds debts and obligation. Throughout the corners of commerce, markets are where wealth is bartered, shared, and changing hands. Profit and wealth come from these myniad exchanges.\"\n-Discourse on Trading, The Bilesen Throne Gelt from Grak\n\nExplorers can combine their charisma and cunning with the force of their wealth and power. Profit Factor can be used in this fashion through Influence Tests. These collective actions are the pivot points whereby Rogue Trader characters can influence powerful organizations within the Imperium.\n\nNaturally, these groups of interstellar traders, adventurers, and Explorers possess incredible wealth and power. Indeed, with their Profit Factor, the force of their will can summon armies, bend whole worlds to their command. Theirs is a dominion of great strength. For the Explorers, using their status and Profit Factor means wealth and power on an unprecedented scale.\n\nINFLUENCE TESTS\nAn Influence Test is a measure of the Explorers' ability to call upon connections they have made with their dynasty's holdings and obligations that the Explorers possess while pursuing their tasks. It is the vessel by which the Explorer influences others who might be part of their dynasty. While roleplaying complex social situations is part of their game, completing a relatively simple Acquisition Test to see if the Explorers' holdings have enough metal for the job might be a more straightforward method to resolve the scene. Player Characters may encounter trades and officers of the mighty Imperium, each with their own PowerFul organizations, forces, and plots to unravel. Their Profit Factor is the force by which they shape their dynasties, countering opponents' movements and pursuing their own advantages through accumulation of substantial profit."

      "text": "While a part of their dynasty roleplaying can be complex, acquiring goods can also avoid harm to the world. Completing an Endeavour should carry an appropriate reward, which in many cases is an improvement in Profit Factor proportional to the challenges that the players overcome.\n\nPowerful stellar traders, lord-captains, commanders of cold-void starships, dynastic merchantmen—these influential explorers are called to step into the void-faring unknown. Their Profit Factor is quite possibly the most challenging element in Endeavours, and yet it's worth it. Some Endeavours are large, challenging Endeavours that have numerous perils and obstacles to overcome before gaining power for their dynasty.\n\nCompleting a Grand Endeavour should lead to a significant increase in Profit Factor—at least nine points. Lesser Endeavours that involve more straightforward tasks might be rewarded with 1 or 2 points. The particular bonuses can also depend upon the style of exploration; these bonuses might become Grand Endeavours with a rewarding outcome while pursuing the main storyline. \n\nOBJECTIVES\nAn objective is a specific undertaking which must be overcome by the Explorers before the Endeavour is complete. A simple Endeavour might require just one objective, while more complex Endeavours require the Explorers to accomplish several objectives.\n\nCREATING AN ENDEAVOUR\nThe Game Master creates an Endeavour by assigning several objectives that the Explorers must accomplish, meeting necessary requirements and gathering the results of their plans. These objectives are created by the GM. Each objective should have a theme and the Game Master can connect an Endeavour to multiple campaign arcs.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo represent the points the Explorers have successfully completed, an Endeavour uses Achievement Points. Achieving a successful completion of certain tasks and overcoming obstacles awards Achievement Points. An Endeavour directly corresponds to how many points the Explorers collect, though some Endeavours require the Explorers to collect a certain amount of Achievement Points to complete the Endeavour. When the Explorers have enough points within an objective, that objective is considered complete.\n\nACHIEVEMENT POINTS\nWhen conquering an Endeavour, the Game Master should create details about how the Achievement Points can be earned. The more complicated an Endeavour, the more Achievement Points will be worth. Objective difficulty should be fair to the characters. Once the Explorers have gathered Achievement Points equal to the objective's worth, the objective is considered complete. For example, if an Endeavour has three objectives worth 100, 250, and 400 points, to complete all three objectives, the players would need to gather a total of 750 Achievement Points. Typically, smaller tasks might be worth 10 Achievement Points while larger ones would be worth 100 or more.\n\nENDEAVOUR SIZE\nFor convenience, Endeavours are placed into three categories to represent their importance. These are Lesser Endeavours, Significant Endeavours, and Grand Endeavours. The type reflects the complexity involved to complete and how much impact it may have on a Profit Factor increase.\n\nWhen designing an Endeavour, the GM should set its own difficulty. Junior and Lesser Endeavours should only contain relatively simple objectives to complete with nothing requiring Difficult (-10) Achievement Tests to earn points. Grand and Significant Endeavours should be far more challenging. Senior Endeavours should include multiple objectives worth hundreds of Achievement Points."

The Game Master should take Achievement Points into account when structuring the objectives of the challenge. The objectives can be established by the Explorers or it can be set up by the GM. For example, the PCs might decide they want to increase trade with other Explorers' dynasty and locate a hidden world to exploit within the Koronus Expanse. This desire would then prompt the GM to create an Endeavour to help them realize their ambition. It falls to the GM, however, to determine the difficulty of this requested Endeavour. Among the perils that might come with such an exploration into the Koronus Expanse, danger and xenos encountered form part of the explorers' path. The GM can then create an Endeavour which will be presented to the group.\n\nEXAMPLE\nThe GM can cultivate elements to introduce presence in-game, assisting the Explorers gain Achievement Points for their actions. The GM can refer to the following checklist when developing a Significant Endeavour for the Winterscale Trading Order:\n\n• Determine if the Endeavour will be Lesser, Significant, or Grand\n• Determine the point where the Winterscale Trading Order GM decides to create time-constraints or alternate objectives to whatever the Explorers' Endeavour will be\n• Set up requirements such as goals, allies, goods, or conflicting objectives that represent the bare minimum the Explorers need to embark on the Endeavour\n• Decide on Achievement Point allocation for objectives. The GM is free to make certain objectives particularly hard or challenging\n• Determine if the Explorers will receive certain Achievement Points if they complete the Endeavour in a particular degree\n\nOBJECTIVE THEMES\nObjectives within Endeavours typically fall within common themes that guide the GM and players about what sort of specific actions Explorers will need to accomplish the objective. The most common objective themes include:\n\nMilitary: These objectives are often combat-focused and involve Imperial Guard, defense actions, and military operations.\n\nCriminal: Criminal objectives are often associated with trade routes, pirate activities, unlicensed operations, and smugglers.\n\nExploration: Exploration activities focus on charting the unexplored reaches of the galaxy. Discovering new worlds, cataloguing bizarre celestial phenomena, guiding ships through particularly dangerous asteroid fields are examples of Exploration objectives.\n\nTABLE 9-40: ACHIEVEMENT POINT AWARDS\nTest Difficulty | Achievement Points Awarded | Example\n---------------|---------------------------|--------\nVery Hard | 20-50 | Dealing with particularly dangerous areas\nHard | 15-40 | Finding a particularly elusive clue\nDifficult | 10-30 | Searching a large area carefully\nChallenging | 5-20 | Following a set of tracks\nOrdinary | 1-10 | Speaking with friendly locals"

Many of these Endeavour types and their requirements can be touched on briefly for the GM's reference rather than getting into meticulous details. Most of the information on running Endeavours is provided here for the GM so that either format can be used. Rather than forcing the Explorers directly toward one goal instead of inspiration from their challenges, these basic kinds of Endeavours are helpful as guidelines.\n\nESTABLISH AN IMPERIAL COLONY\nCreating and running colonies is a staple of the Rogue Trader's right of passage into areas where others cannot go. By virtue of a Warrant of Trade, an Explorer can adventure to the farthest reaches of space, claim worlds for the Imperium, and establish colonies that export wealth for the PCs' dynasty. With only a small degree of direction, colonies can be established with nobles and pilgrims, compacts with merchant-princes or Adeptus Mechanicus denizens.\n\nExample Requirements:\nRegardless of how a colony is established, a world colony should take longer to establish in full. Most of the colony's lab-installations require a preliminary survey to confirm viability before colonization. Colony lab-installations need to be constructed with the Machine Cult's support. The Rogue Trader might also require sanctioning by a high priest of the Calixis sector. These are just a few examples to supplant the GM's own plot ideas.\n\nThe group should decide which organization established their name, whether or not that organization accepts their founding. Once an organization accepts a colony, benefits from their specialized equipment can be conferred on the Imperial outposts.\n\nRESOLVING ENDEAVOURS\nAn Endeavour is considered complete when the Explorers manage to achieve the Endeavour's objective by earning enough Achievement Points across all objectives. Once the Explorers complete the overall Endeavour (or perhaps an important objective, at the GM's discretion), their efforts are rewarded with an increase in Profit Factor provided that enough Achievement Points were gained.\n\nTHE FIRST COLONY OF GRACE\nThe Rogue Trader finally managed to establish a colony called Grace. Competing merchant interests have stymied efforts to find easy Cold Guild wealth through the shadowy realms of the Founding World, but with fortitude and Grace, the Explorers complete the overall Endeavour.\n\nObjective: Confirm Grace is Suitable as a Colony World\nFor this Achievement Point collection, the Rogue Trader needed to accomplish the following (total: 350 Achievement Points):\n• Perform a preliminary survey and confirm that the world has a sufficient hostile environment (100 points)\n• Secure a Warrant of Trade from Port Wander (100 points)\n• Contract with the Machine Cult to provide sufficient colony lab-installations (75 points)\n• Ensure that there are no hostile feral orks already present (75 points)"

Possible challenges include gaining the trust of any Zaythi faction when their word is trusted over yours, filling in history, or perhaps dealing with a trader who has forsaken the Zaythi in striking down a rival.\n\nObjective: Aid the Zaythi Against the Orks\nTheme: Military, Trade\nThe Zaythi are threatened by the Orks of Degeneration. Any Cold Trader knows that without Zaythi allies, the battles against numerous Ork warbands cannot prevail. The Zaythi allies risk falling to Misfortunes if their War-heads fail under attack from the sky as the terrible Orks descend.\n\nEstablish a Trade Route from Port Wander to the Drusus Marches\nSignificant Endeavour. Profit Factor +5.\nOne of the most lucrative activities for the Great Trading Houses is ensuring consistent trade connections between Port Wander and the worlds of the Drusus Marches. With such a route, quantities of luxury goods and valuable rarities from the frontier worlds could be released into the markets of the Drusus Marches with great reward. To keep this route open and stocked behind this market, the Rogue Trader's merchants might face many perils for their dynasty.\n\nObjective: Ally with Greater Rogue Traders\nTheme: Trade\nBecause of the power and authority wielded by other Rogue Traders, the Rogue Trader must explore his peers' domains and forge necessary alliances. Other Rogue Traders are reluctant to enter into such compacts either through suspicion or pride.\n\nObjective: Establish a Hive World Market\nTheme: Criminal, Trade\nHaving more lords across multiple hive worlds means the Rogue Trader and his factors gain wealth rapidly. Resistance from already established merchant houses cannot be avoided. The trade for the worlders, however, must be restored somehow through connections with Eldar who have secured market rights."

      "text": "CHAPTER X: THE GAME MASTER\n\"As long as you don't board my vessel, Lord Seraph...\"\n-First Tenet of the Strictures of the Nobilite\n\nWarhammer 40,000 is a dark and deadly place filled with wonders and horrors that stretch the very limits of human imagination. It is a universe where Mankind struggles against the cold night and the nameless terrors amid the faceless eternity. Only the bold, the brave and the damned have the right to wander the stars among the worlds of our Emperor's domains. Even mandated by the Emperor himself to expand His realms and bring profit and wealth to His domains.\n\nIn Rogue Trader, the players take the mantles of daring explorers and traders pushing back the veil of darkness that shrouds the Imperium, and guiding their world, the Game Master spinning around them, creates opportunities, allies, enemies, and fantastical adventures.\n\nTHE ROLE OF THE GAME MASTER\nIn Rogue Trader, a roleplaying game, all the players will take the role of a character except one: the Game Master (GM). The GM's role is vital. While creating familiar settings, describing the world in which the player characters (PCs) will be moving, the role of the GM is to guide the plot and decide the outcome of the players' actions.\n\nIn many ways, the GM is a director of a movie, describing the scenes and the locations and what the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are doing. Unlike film, however, roleplaying games foster a dialogue between player and Game Master, and while the GM may set the scene, it then falls to the players to decide the actions of their characters.\n\nThis is where the other role of the GM comes in. In addition to being the director and storyteller, the GM is also the referee. While Rogue Trader uses rules to adjudicate the actions of the PCs, and determine the outcome of their endeavours, the GM helps decide when and where they need to be interpreted. Making sure that the game remains playable, fair, and enjoyable for all concerned.\n\nFinally, because the GM is the setting creator and describes the universe that the player characters will be exploring, this means that effectively the GM is in charge of everyone and everything that isn't directly controlled by the players."

      "text": "The modern roleplaying game follows a pattern commonly known as adventures or scenarios. Everything that occurs in Rogue Trader can be described by the GM, who must also play the part of innocent bystanders and other inhabitants of the universe. From the lowest hive-ganger to the mightiest planetary governor, deciding how they react and the actions they take with the PCs. The conflict emerges from this interaction. Often enthusiastic about his role, the GM must donning the veneer of many different characters at a moment's notice.\n\nCHOOSING THE GM\nThe role of the GM is complex; his job is creative and rewarding. It is usually taken by the person who has organized the group in the first place. The satisfaction of bringing enjoyment to the players as well. This is probably also the person who has bought this book.\n\nIt is also common that over time, several of the group's members take turns sharing the role of the GM. Since the GM helps shape and guide the story, creating their own adventures. This allows a chance for each player to make their own stories and can ensure that none of the others become jaded with the GM's plots.\n\nTHE BASICS\nDELEGATING TO PLAYERS\nWhile Rogue Trader could be run with just the GM doing all the organizational work, the roleplaying game experience does not need to place all the burden on one person. Many successful groups distribute tasks between the GM and the other players.\n\nBefore running the first game, Chapter I: Playing the Game contains all of the ingredients for successful gaming. While the rules mechanics are a cornerstone of the game's fundamental workings, knowing them doesn't make you an expert GM. Knowing the rules helps the GM make quick and fair adjudications on the actions of the players.\n\nThe most important contribution players can make is becoming familiar with what their character is designed to do well. For example, players can get to know the world their character hails from, or pick a homeworld that connects to the roleplaying game if the players and their characters are aliens to the world and are the heroes confronting the dark and foreboding future of the 41st millennium.\n\nKnow the Plot\nIf the Game Master is the director of this plot, he or she also controls the actions and motivations of everyone in the universe except the PCs. Roleplaying is collaborative in nature; background details help the GM make adventures richer.\n\nMost roleplaying game scenarios a prepared sub-plot should not be killed before the players get a chance to determine their actions. When the Game Master's NPCs are threatening them with drawn bolt pistols, arriving with Confederate Fleet captain comes to purge heretics, working fresh from the planet Purgation, or sealing off a market for cheap off-world goods.\n\nHaving a more detailed plot typically makes the GM's life easier. This means the GM can keep the game flowing even if players ask for names, figures for helping characters they meet, or query what is behind the closed door. Complex plots require work before the gaming session. Most basic roleplaying supplies can be found on page 8 in published adventures detailed in Chapter 1, \"Using the Source Material.\""

      "text": "THE DARK FRONTIER: EVOKING THE SETTING\n\"As long as you don't board my vessel, Lord Seraph...\"\n-First Tenet of the Strictures of the Nobilite\n\nThe Ancient and the Forgotten\nThe Imperium is filled with mysticism and superstition, and travelers with eyes firmly averted from the shadows that circle the void. Captains of Rogue Trader vessels exploring the borders of the Expanse encounter the perils of ancient starships and strange technology. The unlucky-headed Explorer rejects far older relics that existed long before human technology was even conceived. Curious artifacts of esoteric apparatus lie dormant with technology that few understand. From the Feranti Maelstrom to the Zayth Cults, the Helios Wanderer faction embraces the Imperium uneasily. Those brave few who travel along well-charted paths past the dark edges of the warp should do so without danger. Such millennium-old crews of Rogue Trader starships must have the players become uniquely powerful individuals with power far beyond that of most common citizens. These explorers cut into the Unknown, pushing back the boundaries of the Emperor's domain and carve out a Rogue Trader's quest for profitable trade routes. Should they actually become successful, they also stand among the most wealthy and influential men. These unique explorers acquire unknown resources, what worlds and men influence with wealth and means. Societies can be built from the crusade against the ancient powers—with luck, courage, and ambition there are few restrictions of travel imposed on a Rogue Trader. A normal man cannot leave his home world and wake from stasis journeys to succeed in Rogue Trader voyages into the unknown. From here, the choices really come from ambition and financial achievements.\n\nWHAT IF NO ONE WANTS TO BE THE ROGUE TRADER?\nIt is possible that none of the players will want to take the role of the Rogue Trader, either because they find the responsibilities daunting or they feel their characters have other concepts that interest them more. While it is advantageous to have a player controlling the Rogue Trader, it is not essential, and there are a few key ways to bring color into the campaign if this eventuality arises.\n\nThe GM could have the Rogue Trader run as an NPC. The Rogue Trader may exist but he will lack predictable nature, meaning he must issue orders as if he is based upon his bridge in reserve. The messages help deliver specific instructions to inform the players of the role of other characters when crisis falls. He commands vessel and voyage, but the players interpret the Rogue Trader's wishes through whatever esoteric means of communication were still open.\n\nAlternatively, the Rogue Trader might not even appear. The Dynasty makes decisions, pounding his fists into the table about contraband. From the halls of Holy Terra itself, they can travel free and access the voids. From some conquered world full of leadership decisions, the characters investigate a command ship. Where most power-mad violent captains either excel or fail, the Game Master should be careful to use the Rogue Trader's influence sparingly and not overwhelm the party's decisions in their own fate."

      "text": "EXPLORING THE CALIXIS SECTOR\nWhile much of the background for the Rogue Trader world centers upon the Koronus Expanse and regions beyond the reach of the Imperium, there remains ample opportunities for exploration and adventure within the Calixis Sector itself. Like much of the Imperium, the Calixis Sector has many empty spaces with plenty of uncharted worlds. The Hazeroth Abyss, the Adrantis Nebula, and the Hazeroth Abyss offer exciting and interesting locales for Rogue Traders and their ships. The mysteries of the Tyrant Star can also provide many layers of interest.\n\nFear the Void\nRogue Traders risk life and sanity when venturing beyond the Imperium. They venture into the inky darkness of space, watching the night sky with fear, trying not to dwell on just what terrors might be looking back at them. It is not those who travel with wealth and dominion over worlds, for the wealthy are protected by men who make something of themselves in the light surrounded by darkness. Dark and hackneyed as it might seem, the void is still present now and then like a terrible menace that must be fought back. Especially true and terrifying things lurking in the depths of space make possible adventures through the void. Very literally it makes Rogue Traders the bigger-than-life individuals that they are as they search across the length and breadth of space with their stake in hard trade. Even the fact that if a place is lethal, the price gained for their ventures is correspondingly high. Rogue Trader adventures also have the advantage of being mobile and easily transplanted if the GM feels that a simple speed will suffice.\n\nHOW TO RUN A ROGUE TRADER ADVENTURE\nOSTENSIBLY, the players are the command crew of a trading starship with the means and license to travel between Imperial worlds. The potential for interesting adventures spans Imperialis Vast, with a plethora of great resources. Yet many adventures can begin from the very simple act of sailing off into adventure itself. This can be a springboard into darker plots and mysteries. Almost anything can be the focus of a Rogue Trader adventure—wealth, thought, space pirates, uncharted regions, unknown worlds can be lost for millennia—and including the most outlandish ideas into the field of the Emperor's light. Likewise, someone opposing the command crews can cause conflict within the dynasty or beyond. Any style of play for the Game Master to enjoy with his players who can find such themes and elements worthwhile.\n\nSTYLES OF PLAY\nThere are numerous styles of play that lead themselves naturally to a Rogue Trader campaign. Focusing on the different kinds of adventures a Rogue Trader might have, one can tell how this game might take shape. Some common adventure themes are Trade and Mercantile Expansion, looking for empty worlds and opportunities, Exploration where much is unknown, the Cold Trade, profit and greed."

      "text": "WHAT IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON WANTS TO BE THE ROGUE TRADER?\nRogue Trader normally assumes the idea that one character takes the role of the Rogue Trader and the other players take the roles of his most trusted counsellors who have power in their own right. However, there will be times when more than one player wishes to take center stage.\n\nWhen this happens, the GM has several options as to how he can handle the situation:\n\nFirst, if multiple players insist upon being Rogue Traders in the same campaign, the GM can decide that the Rogue Traders are siblings or some similar relation, all being part of the same journey. Critically, the holder of the Warrant of Trade might be a distant, NPC Patriarch Rogue Trader, and the player characters appear to be the actual holders of the Warrant whilst the others are considered both assistants and heirs.\n\nAnother option is to have the group composed of multiple Rogue Trader characters, each possessing his own warrant and commanding his own vessel. This option means that the group is actually split amongst a small fleet or convoy of allied families seeking their fortune. Sometimes an agreement exists between Rogue Trader families through alliance or similar field charter. Rogue Trader characters might combine their resources by pooling their fleets together such as a single vessel and that each of the characters is a stakeholder in the overall venture.\n\nPerhaps things have turned desperate, and to survive, multiple Rogue Trader types must band together in order to seek their fortune as a guild venture, war, crusade. They have laid much of what they own on the line (including perhaps their own vessels and forces).\n\nROGUE TRADER DYNASTIES\nThe Rogue Trader game allows the players to portray truly exceptional individuals with power and influence that surpasses that of common men. Each Rogue Trader and his team has more than merely a ship's empty holds and crew; they are unique dynastic merchantmen who control stretches of space through hundreds of thousands of systems. Typically, a Rogue Trader dynasty seeking to expand the Emperor's power will also be hunting greedy exchanges who could damage the wealth associated with significant territories. For generations and centuries, the control of worlds belongs to a Rogue Trader and his dynasty.\n\nAll of these wealthy houses, the names really matter—PCs not just the Rogue Trader will benefit from this dynasty. While behind the scenes, most of these factors might not concern the players much since the GM realizes he has to focus on the direct actions of their particular individuals chosen to lead. These are those who help the trading exploration of power across the domains of the Imperium. One important distinction for the Game Master regarding Warrant bearers: people who come into contact with them and their dynasty can be strict about their conquest, piracy, pride, or trade. But fundamentally they are blessed with incredible wealth from the Emperor's designs rather than creating trading with newly discovered worlds or opening up the worlds one by one to Imperial influence. Though only one player controls the Rogue Trader, all of the players' characters are equally part of the dynasty. The Game Master should keep this in mind when designing adventures. Focusing solely on the Rogue Trader's command brings the adventure to no one and any player's character might become the focus for a scene or plot."

      "text": "When planning adventures, Games Masters should consider the skills of each of the PCs and ensure possible moments where every player should have his character's spotlight when certain Skills come into play. Adventures should frustrate no player if he feels his character has no chance to shine.\n\nTABLE 10-1: ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY\nDifficulty | Meaning\n-----------|--------\nRoutine | Very Easy\nOrdinary | Easy\nChallenging | Standard\nDifficult | Hard\nVery Hard | Extremely Hard\n\nNPC Crew Members\n\nAbstract Method\nDue to the scale and safety of the Imperium, often most starships carry thousands of crew members. This is the easiest (and certainly for beginning GMs, the recommended) method to avoid complexity. Based simply on the amount of staggering imagination required, place them when and where they are needed and common sense dictates. With great power for the characters comes great responsibility. Any player who wishes to receive some Warrant to the PCs will make up the functioning crew, with possibly others that would include trusted or wealthy individuals according to the Game Master's desires. Some of the more important Non-Player Characters (or Crew Members as they are commonly known) require about several dozen to command a player's ship. For most cases the GM can merely indicate their presence through a casual mention as a mere background detail. However, the detailed method can provide an interesting depth if possible.\n\nDetailed Method\nSome might want a more detailed method to calculate exactly how many crewmembers are manning critical portions of a player's vessel. This method can help identify where each reward is broken down on a case-by-case basis for individual player characters.\n\nREWARDS: THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS\nRewards come for adventurers that include dangerous encounters, pitched battle or otherwise, while narrow victory might confer more than three encounters would. Rogue Trader naturally assumes that you should match rewards when the encounters were completed. Outcome/Results/Difficulty, Game Masters (GMs) reward player characters as they complete objectives. GMs may use the difficulty found in Table 10-1: Encounter Difficulty when considering how much player characters should receive for overcoming a challenge and what the reward is worth. These rewards come in several forms: experience points (if the group uses them), wargear, equipment that allows players to increase the skills of their characters, and profit gains that add to the crew's wealth.\n\nWhen using these methods, remember that the Game Master provides a fast or early reward. Some campaigns require a meaningful change in a Game Master's campaign presented here to guide players that embark on the viable adventures likely to be worth the Game Master's time and effort. Once rewards are determined, player characters gain points and can overcome challenges worth more experience.\n\nEXPERIENCE POINTS\nThe primary collection of rewards is Experience Points (XP). More than anything else, a character's actions drive the Experience Points which players spend on Skills, Talents, and character advancement. The more a character deals with challenges, the more Experience Points they earn, leading to greater progress towards character power and how able they will be to defeat any challenge they could face.\n\nThere are two main ways for the GM to award experience: the Abstract Method and the Detailed Method."

      "text": "PROFIT FACTOR REWARDS\nIn addition to Experience Points, the GM may decide that the individual efforts of the Explorers are worthy of an increase in Profit Factor. Typically, gains in Profit Factor are the result of Endeavours (see page 276), which combine influence and power. This method should save time and planning.\n\nTHE DETAILED METHOD\nIn this method, the GM can orchestrate combat and decide that the individual actions of the Explorers gain them a greater Profit Factor. Using this method allows the GM to track the strength of the characters and control combat encounters. The GM should group similar combatants on both sides of the battlefield. This option should comprise of between 5 and 20 combatants. For example, if the characters were accompanied by 150 guardsmen with lasguns and flak armor, the GM would divide them into four groups:\n\n1. One group of 20 guardsmen with las weapons, each with Wounds equal to a single individual armed with a common weapon and armor\n2. A second group of 20 guardsmen with las weapons, each with Wounds equal to a single individual armed with a common weapon and armor\n3. A third group of 20 guardsmen with las weapons, each with Wounds equal to a single individual armed with a common weapon and armor\n4. A fourth group of 90 guardsmen with shotguns and 30 Wounds. Add a +5 to damage.\n\nThe GM then plays the combat using normal combat with the following exceptions. Named individuals (PCs, powerful creatures, and notable characters) things that skill with more wounds) all act in the Initiative order unless an ability changes that (though at the GM's discretion, some of its broken members may act slightly earlier or later). Individuals cannot harm units and unit members cannot harm individuals. Units and individuals count as separate combatants for positioning purposes, etc.\n\nAWARDING FATE POINTS\nFinally, so rare is it possible that the Game Master rewards players with permanent Fate Points for truly remarkable actions. The GM should use this sparingly.\n\nWHEN TO USE REWARDS\nMost Game Masters award experience points at the end of gaming sessions. The GM may wish to avoid giving himself the time between sessions to work out what the PCs have accomplished. Some GMs focus on profit and other rewards because they enjoy seeing the characters' progress and feel tracking rewards more precisely would detract from the adventure. The Rogue Trader Adventure Track handles their character advancement naturally without forcing the Game Master to make arbitrary decisions over others.\n\nTHE SIMPLE METHOD\nThis method quickly resolves a single encounter and focuses more on the cinematic aspects of play. It's appropriate when the GM wants to work out what the PCs have accomplished during a battle without rolling every single attack. The Game Master should pick a single characteristic and have each PC make one Test based on this characteristic for the encounter. For example, if they're in the thick of the fighting, a Weapon Skill Test while a more cerebral character would make an Intelligence Test.\n\nThe difficulty of this test is determined by the GM and can be based upon the enemy's skills, the environment, or anything else he thinks might matter. The results of this test indicate how the character performed during combat. For example, the GM might require a combined total of 10 successes for the PCs to win. Success or failure on an individual test might also indicate whether a character took wounds or was incapacitated. If the GM wants to include the effects of the battle, he rolls 1d5 for each character receiving wounds. Note that this arbitrary damage should not kill or incapacitate characters. If the GM wants to include the effects of the battle, he can also have people skill-roll for fate in the same fashion."

      "text": "INTERACTION\nEXAMPLE\nCaptain Mortiz of the PDF meets Ezekiel Proverbial to unload his cargo planetside without a full inspection (potentially illegal). The GM decides that Ezekiel's Charm Skill Test would be a Routine (+20) Test if Ezekiel can present matching calculations with the Excise Captain's official manifest. When the GM describes Captain Mortiz, the player decides to use Fellowship rather than Charm. The GM assigns a Disposition for Mortiz based on circumstances.\n\nDISPOSITIONS\nThe varied peoples that inhabit the worlds of the Imperium are as diverse as there are planets. The Administratum hierarchy and countless cultures include many dispositions. The Game Master should consider an NPC's particular disposition as the most important aspect of the NPCs the player characters hope to deal with in their quest for profit and glory. The player character regards him as an NPC Captain, a disposition with certain consequences.\n\nINTERACTION SKILLS\nThe Difficulty of an Interaction Skill Test (see Chapter III: Skills) corresponds to the disposition of the NPC. Table 10-2: Dispositions assigns a simple interaction for an NPC. Using Fellowship to befriend another character would require a Command, Charm, or Intimidate Test. For every Degree of Success on a successful Test, the NPC's disposition would improve by one step. For every Degree of Failure, the NPC's disposition would worsen by one step. Together, these Skills offer a means to interact with the people of the Imperium. The target will only react to what the player is attempting to achieve. Usually, the player Games Master uses Interaction Skills in conjunction with roleplaying, simply playing the role of both characters for interactions between the NPC and his character.\n\nINTERACTION GROUPS\nWhen a situation involves a group, the player should perform an Interaction Skill against the group. The Game Master sets the disposition based on the prevailing attitude of the group. While some group members may hold something against the player, this does not outweigh the feelings of the group as a whole. The following modifiers may affect Interaction Tests when dealing with a considerable number of individuals. This requires respect that a player affects with social actions. Note that these modifiers stack with other modifiers. The player should inform the GM of his chosen Interaction Skill before he attempts any Test.\n\nTABLE 10-2: DISPOSITIONS\nDisposition | Charm | Command | Deceive | Intimidate | Scrutiny | Trade\n------------|-------|---------|---------|------------|---------|------\nAdoring | Routine | Routine | Challenging | Very Hard | Ordinary | Challenging\nFriendly | Ordinary | Ordinary | Difficult | Hard | Challenging | Ordinary\nAmiable | Challenging | Challenging | Challenging | Difficult | Difficult | Challenging\nIndifferent | Difficult | Difficult | Difficult | Challenging | Hard | Difficult\nDisliking | Hard | Hard | Hard | Ordinary | Very Hard | Hard\nHostile | Very Hard | Very Hard | Very Hard | Challenging | — | Very Hard"

A Rogue Trader and his allies must deal with these perils if they journey in search of fortune and glory.

      "text": "DEGREES OF FEAR\nVERY BAD THINGS\nA degree of fear is clearly more frightening than others. Orks are very much the same; a Rogue Trader facing a boarding party of hideous brutes or mutants. The GM will assign when and where they occur and should follow precedent when establishing a result. While (fear level) governs how dangerous a specific creature or entity might be, Fear Tests only apply to situations of peril. However, facing a boarding party of mutants would certainly warrant a Fear Test. The distinction of degrees of fear can diminish with repeated occurrence and novelty. Having dealt with aliens would certainly make them less psychologically disturbing to the player characters. That meeting Kroot warriors would certainly mean GMs need to call for a Fear Test categorized in Table 10-3: Fear Test Difficulties as merely Disturbing (+0). Viewing the scene of a wholesale massacre, witnessing uncommon psychic phenomena, or seeing spectral images can be Frightening (-10). Confronting the terror of hostile deamonic entities is Horrifying (-20). Meeting Daemons is Terrifying (-30).\n\nFAILING THE FEAR TEST\nIf a character fails a Fear Test in a combat situation, they must immediately roll on the Shock Table. Add to the roll for each Degree of Failure; the effects listed hereafter immediately impact the character. First, the character fails the Fear Test in a non-combat situation, he becomes paralyzed with shock. The character suffers a -20 penalty to any Skill Test that requires concentration on his part. This means the character suffers a sudden and inexplicable terror of the object of his fear (simply fleeing and coming back again doesn't stop this). Beyond the shock of finding yourself covered in chemical residue with no recollection of how you got there, or witnessing what is occurring right before your very eyes, experiencing what millions of humans have experienced can be Terrifying (-30).\n\nSHOCK AND SNAPPING OUT OF IT\nCharacters may be able to take a Willpower Test to break free after the initial shock has worn off. Where specified on the Shock Table, the character may make a Willpower Test at the beginning of his next Turn. If the test is successful, the character snaps out of the effect and may act normally from then on. If the Willpower Test is failed, the effects continue; the character must make another test at the beginning of each of his subsequent turns until he succeeds. Characters driven catatonic from fear cannot make this test unless their situation drastically changes somehow.\n\nFEAR\nFear comes into effect when the adventurers are confronted with horror: when they walk into battle against a terrifying alien, or encounter bizarre and nightmarish entities from the warp. When confronted by a frightening or alien Adversary, he must take a Fear Test; this is a Willpower Test, modified by how frightening the thing is. If the PC passes this Test, he may continue as normal. A failed Test, however, leads to various degrees of mental damage."

Compare the result to Table 10-6: Mental Traumas. The result applies to the character in the immediate aftermath of the encounter. In general, the Insanity Points a traveller may accumulate in his lifetime might include: witnessing unnatural death, prolonged periods in the warp, dealing with the xenos, or facing the horrors of war. These experiences wear on the character's mind. Game Masters might grant characters a Minor Disorder when they gain 10 Insanity Points, a Severe Disorder when they reach 20 Insanity Points, and a third disorder (Major or Extreme) when they reach 30 Insanity Points. Most humans in the 41st millennium are hardened but exceptions exist. Characters in Rogue Trader might represent such exceptions.\n\nGAINING MENTAL DISORDERS\nMental Disorders represent the long-term effects of a character's mind of exposure to things horrific and unnatural. In Rogue Trader, a character gains a new disorder (or an existing disorder gets worse) each time the character gains 10 Insanity Points. For each 10 Insanity Points a character gains, the character gains one Minor Disorder when he hits 10 Insanity Points (cumulative). The character gains one Severe Disorder when he hits 20 Insanity Points. The character gains one Major Disorder when he hits 30 Insanity Points. (This corresponds to where a character begins to become Warped on the Insanity Track). Particularly bad experiences can be rewarded with additional or permanent Insanity Points to reflect a character's descent into madness as tracked on Table 10-5: The Insanity Track. When determining what disorder a character has acquired, the disorder is selected by the GM or the player may select one if he prefers. The GM may both present and interpret how the disorder manifests for 1d5 hours.\n\nDEGREES OF MADNESS\nRegardless of severity, even before \"Severe\" enters the picture, most disorders manifest in different ways. With the exception of \"The Flesh is Weak\" disorder that has both a Minor Version and a Major Version of Madness depending on Insanity Points, this classification is a broad idea of the state of a character's mind. The Degree of Madness also determines the modifier that will apply at a given time.\n\nEXAMPLE\nExplorer Amanda has suffered a Critical Hit from a Giant Ork. She has to roll for Mental Trauma and has 5 Insanity Points so far. Her Willpower Test is a -10; if she fails she will need to roll on the Mental Trauma Table. If Amanda's Insanity Points increase to 10, she would gain her first Mental Disorder. It was clearly traumatic for Eldar Corsair as it would be for nearly any human character.\n\nMENTAL TRAUMA\nMental Trauma represents relatively short-term effects and shock to a character's mind that he suffers after experiencing horrors. Each time the character gains Insanity Points, he must make a Mental Trauma Test. This is a Willpower Test, with a -10 modifier for every 10 Insanity Points the character has gained (see the Insanity Track). If the test succeeds, the character manages to cope well without further issues. If the test fails, roll on Table 10-6: Mental Traumas."

The character takes a -10 penalty to all Fellowship-based Tests for 1d5 hours.\n41-60 | The character constantly feels like something is crawling all over him; checking for insects, and so on. The character is at -10 to Perception-based Tests for 1d5 hours.\n61-80 | The character must lock himself in his chambers for 1d5 hours. The effect of this trauma pushes the character to withdraw. He may not leave his chambers until the effect has worn off.\n81-00 | The character feels that the warp is watching him. The character suffers a -10 to Willpower Tests for 1d5 hours.\n\nDISORDERS AND THEIR SEVERITY\nThe effect a disorder has on a character is largely up to the GM, though the descriptions presented below provide a framework. A character that suffers from an uncommon disorder will undergo certain effects. Players should be able to roleplay the effects of the disorder without requiring the GM to enforce them. When a character with a disorder encounters a situation that would trigger the effects of the disorder, the following guidelines apply:\n\nMinor Disorder: The effects of the disorder manifest for a minor length of time (a few minutes or hours). The effects of the disorder give the character a -10 modifier to any Test directly affected.\n\nSevere Disorder: The effects of the disorder manifest for 1d5 hours. Any Test directly affected by the effects of the disorder gains a -20 modifier.\n\nMajor Disorder: The effects of the disorder manifest for 1d5 days. The character is at -30 to all Tests directly affected by the effects of the disorder.\n\nAcute Disorder: The effects of the disorder are permanent. The character must make a Willpower Test at -30 to overcome the effects of the disorder.\n\nTYPES OF MENTAL DISORDER\nThe variety of unwholesome disorders that can afflict a character is presented here as a guide. GMs should also feel free to develop individual disorders not listed here.\n\nPHOBIA\nThe character has a deep dislike and fear of a particular subject. When confronted with the focus of his phobia, the character must make a Fear Test.\n\nTHE FLESH IS WEAK\nThe character mistrusts his flesh and will actively harm himself and his limbs. He will also eagerly undergo bionic replacement, seeking surgical modification at the first chance.\n\nFEAR OF THE DEAD\nThe character has an abiding fear of corpses and the dead, possibly due to some incident they don't recall. Dead bodies terrify the character and he must pass a Fear Test to even be in the same room as a corpse."

The character must make a Willpower Test when confronted with insects or suffer horrific nightmares and feelings of numberless creatures forever crawling beneath his skin.\n\nINVULNERABILITY\nThe character believes he is invulnerable to harm and danger either through luck or divine providence. The character would have to pass a Willpower Test at -10 to retreat from any challenge.\n\nOBSESSION/COMPULSION\nThe character has become obsessed with a particular thing or action and must perform a particular ritual or action continuously. When the opportunity arises, the character must make a Willpower Test not to indulge in his obsession. Examples might include washing hands constantly, muttering insults and curses, counting objects obsessively, etc.\n\nRIGHTEOUSNESS\nThe character believes his choices are all innately right and just no matter what the consequences. The character cannot tolerate what he feels is wrong and will denounce evildoers no matter how dangerous the situation.\n\nKLEPTOMANIA\nSeriousness: Minor, Severe, Major\nThe character is compelled to steal small objects when unobserved. Once the character spots such objects, the character suffers a -10 to all Tests to resist the urge to steal them.\n\nHORRIFIC NIGHTMARES\nSeriousness: Minor, Severe, Major\nThe character suffers from recurring nightmares and must make a Hard (-20) Willpower Test to fall asleep. If he fails, the character suffers a -10 to all Tests from fatigue the next day.\n\nSELF-MORTIFICATION\nAfter any stressful activity, the character must scourge and whip his flesh to purge his torment or suffer a -10 to all Willpower Tests. If the character also has Mental Trauma (see page 297), the character gains the Trauma through Self Mortification.\n\nVISIONS AND VOICES\nSeriousness: Minor, Severe, Major, Acute\nThe character hears voices not there and sees things that don't exist, and is completely immersed within these visions.\n\nDEAD COMRADE\nSeriousness: Minor, Severe, Major\nThe character hears or sees an old friend now long-dead. With a Minor condition, he may have visions of his friend. If his condition becomes Acute, the ghost may converse with the character.\n\nFLASHBACKS\nThe character relives moments from his life, with the surrounding reality melting away to previous episodes according to the seriousness of his condition. Each flashback causes a level of Mental Trauma.\n\nDELUSION\nSeriousness: Minor, Severe, Acute\nThe character maintains a particular false belief that he holds despite evidence to the contrary.

      "text": "EXAMPLE\nContact with Chaos forces (i.e., Frightening equals 1d5 Corruption Points). Determine what effect the chaos radiation has on the skin, mind, and moral strength. A character with 15 Corruption Points or more is considered a vehicle for the forces of Chaos.\n\nRENDING THE VEIL\nEvents that strengthen ties to the power of Chaos include prolonged exposure to warp storms, full-blown intrusion of the warp into physical space (such as a breach), and similar occurrences. These events might grant the character a single Corruption Point or more depending on the severity of the breach.\n\nCORRUPTION\nThe most insidious of the three (Fear, Insanity, and Corruption) is indeed Corruption. This represents the corrupting influence of Chaos on physical space, innate mutation, and the mental temptations that daemonic forces can lead to overall. Corruption brings madness just as surely as more mundane horrors, but it also brings vile mutating influence. A character might be corrupted by his actions quite aside from his knowledge; the influence of Chaos is immense and dangerous to normal human beings. Continued exposure leads to corruption of mind and soul.\n\nSORCERY\nThe practice of sorcery, witnessing dread rituals, and invoking the corrupting energies of the warp remains one of the fastest routes to corruption regardless of the caution exercised. Minor rituals grant 1d5 Corruption Points, major sorcerous workings 1d10, and forbidden knowledge that reveals the nature of the warp grants 2d10.\n\nBLASPHEMOUS LORE\nKnowledge gained through the study of certain pseudo-religious texts might tear the veil of warp/space and damage the mind. Nearly all pre-Imperial lore and even some cleansed Imperial text contains heretical material. Characters exposed to such knowledge gain Corruption Points. Scanning written materials grants 1 Corruption Point, detailed study of older texts 1d5, and blasphemous material 1d10.\n\nDARK DEEDS\nTaking deliberate actions for personal gain, walking darker paths for the furtherance of a malignant goal, or in itself committing acts of evil can lead to a tainting of the soul. Appealing to daemon allies or foul powers can also grant Corruption Points.\n\nCORRUPTION POINTS\nCorruption Points (CP) operate in a similar manner to Insanity Points except that they represent physical mutation rather than mental damage. Like Insanity Points, a character accumulates Corruption Points over time with his current total tracked on the Corruption Track. Characters with accumulated Corruption Points might suffer mutations; when this occurs, the effects are tracked by the GM using Table 10-7: The Corruption Track.\n\nVILE PERSUASION\nAn influential daemonic persuader or heretical leader can draw others into darkness, sowing the seeds of doubt and corruption. A listener can gain 1d5 Corruption Points if he hears such words. Characters hearing heretical teachings from a persuasive source gain Corruption Points even if they would naturally resist these influences.\n\nTHE MALIGNANCY TEST\nFor every 10 Corruption Points a character gains, he must make a special Willpower Test called a Malignancy Test. This test is modified depending on the character's current Corruption level (see Table 10-7: The Corruption Track). If the Test is failed, the character acquires a Corruption Point. The metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies.\n\nWARP SHOCK\nTraumatic incidents dealing with the warp can inflict Corruption. If a character fails a Willpower Test that he previously suffered for failing a Willpower Test when encountering a serious Malignancy, he may roll again.\n\nCHAOS AND THE COMMON CITIZEN\nThe rules for Corruption provided here are for use with player characters. A character's Corruption Point Total is also used to determine the Difficulty of Willpower Tests and Prayer rolls a character makes against the effects of Chaos. Most people that the Ruinous Powers corrupt typically remain unaware of the touch Chaos brings, and rarely with conscious deliberation. Wanton destruction, avarice, hatred, and jealousy all corrode the mind and body alike."

      "text": "MUTATIONS\nWhen a character reaches 30 Corruption Points, his body begins to twist and change, reshaped by the forces of Chaos. The character's personality and characteristics transform of his choice, or he may suffer a random mutation.\n\nFirst, the character must make a Willpower Test against the same difficulty as his last Malignancy Test. If this Test fails, the character should make a note on his Character Sheet of which Characteristic the mutation affects through a Willpower Test. A failed Willpower Test means the character must roll for a Mutation (roll 1d100).\n\nEXAMPLE\nExploring an ancient vault, the Explorers witness the opening of a vile Chaos artifact and each gains 1d5 Corruption Points. For Erasmus, this means he reaches 30 Corruption Points for the first time and must make his first Malignancy Test. Since his current Corruption Point total is 30, he must make a Willpower Test at -10. If he fails his Test, then he must roll to determine which Characteristic is affected (1d10: 1 = WS, 2 = BS, 3 = S, 4 = T, 5 = Ag, 6 = Int, 7 = Per, 8 = WP, 9 = Fel, 10 = roll twice). His roll is 9, so Fellowship (Fel) is affected. If he fails either Test, he will gain a Mutation that changes his appearance forever.\n\nTABLE 10-8: MALIGNANCIES\nRoll | Effect\n-----|-------\n01-06 | Palsy: The character's hands shake with ceaseless agitation, reducing his Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill by 5.\n07-12 | Skin Afflictions: The character is plagued by boils and lesions. Reduce Fellowship by 5.\n13-18 | Night Terrors: The character has terrible nightmares. Each night after sleep, the character makes a Willpower Test or suffers a -5 to all Tests for 1d5 hours.\n19-24 | Unholy Sight: The character finds he can see clearly in gloom and darkness. The character can see in darkness as per the Talent Darkness Sight, but for this his eyes glow with an unholy light.\n25-30 | Fell Obsession: The character gains the Obsession Disorder (see page 297). However, this obsession is darker and more sinister, such as collecting screaming faces, devouring flesh, or bathing in infected blood.\n31-36 | Hatred: The character gains an unnatural hatred of a specific group, individual, or social class. The character must attack the object of his hatred on sight or sound.\n37-42 | Warp Phobia: The character develops a deep irrational fear of an otherwise innocuous thing. The character must pass a Fear (2) Test if the object of fear is present.\n43-48 | Voices: The character hears the whispering voices of daemons. Occasionally they offer advice and the character benefits from the Fellowship Talent. However, the character is permanently at -5 to all Fellowship Tests.\n49-54 | Warp Addiction: The character craves a strange and dangerous substance or feels a pull toward chaotic or disruptive events. The character must make a Willpower Test or act out.\n55-60 | Daemonic Familiar: The character is shadowed by a minor invisible entity. It manifests as strange noises, sinister whispers, and other unusual phenomena when the character is alone.\n61-66 | Dark Dreams: The character must make a Willpower Test each night before sleeping. If he fails, the character suffers horrible nightmares and must make a Willpower Test the next morning. If the Test fails, he gains a level of Fatigue that persists throughout the day.\n67-72 | Bloodlust: The character is overwhelmed with the need to kill. After being wounded in combat, the character must make a Willpower Test or attempt to kill his attacker straight away. Otherwise, he may act as normal.\n73-78 | Unnatural Appetite: The character develops a taste for something disgusting (including raw flesh, blood, the dead, or carrion). The character must make a Willpower Test or indulge when the opportunity presents itself.\n79-84 | Warp Flesh: The character's body begins to shift and change, mutating at random times. The character must make a Willpower Test or suffer a bizarre mutation at an awkward time.\n85-90 | Brass Skin: The character's skin hardens, giving him a metallic appearance. The character gains +1 Natural Armor but reduces his Agility by 5."

Mankind endures through the courage and sacrifice of countless billions. In the far darkness of the future, there exists only war.\"\n- Excerpt from the First Book of the Astronomican\n\nTHE IMPERIUM OF MAN\nFor over 10,000 years, the Imperium has been the bastion of the human race. With a population ranging into countless thousands of billions, it is by far the largest empire in the galaxy. For ten millennia, it has endured traitors, aliens, and the nightmare realm of the warp. The Emperor of Mankind sits silent on the Golden Throne. Though His body is shattered, His will reaches out across the Imperium and guides Mankind's survival.\n\nINSTITUTIONS OF THE IMPERIUM\n\nTHE HIGH LORDS OF TERRA\nThe Imperium is governed by powerful leaders of all organizations who rule the Imperium in the Emperor's name. They match the Emperor's vision and guide humankind from the bureaucratic maze of Terra. Out on the fringes, they are a distant legend, but their power can be felt even across the void.\n\nAlchemical adepts of the Golden Throne maintain the stasis field and watch over the Emperor's form as He foresees the many paths He must guide the Imperium through. He perceives the outcome of the many trials and challenges ahead of Mankind.\n\nThe Imperium is vast, without the Emperor's direct guidance, it would splinter into hundreds of warring mini-empires. His fleets come between Imperial worlds and enforce the Imperial will, developed by the High Lords.\n\nTHE ADEPTUS TERRA\nThe Adeptus Terra is a colossal organization with millions of religious followers whose duty is to enforce the Imperial will. From the highest lords to the lowliest scribe, the Adeptus Terra (or Adeptus Administratum) controls the armies and fleets of the Imperium, ensuring mankind's survival among the stars.\n\nThe Administratum is an organization responsible for assessing and gathering tithes and resources from Imperial worlds, a bureaucratic entity of almost supernatural proportions. Countless minor departments of the Administratum function to control the Imperium and process countless forms and data. Most Imperial citizens will deal with the Administratum at some point in their lives, but few ever meet a high-level member.\n\nThe Adeptus Arbites\nThe Adeptus Arbites are empowered to enforce Imperial law in the Imperium. It is a galactic police force, whose judges and arbitrators patrol throughout Mankind's worlds. Within the Imperium, the Adeptus Arbites are fanatically devoted to enforcing Imperial law and crushing rebellion."

Only a few among their number, called the Companions, actually stand in the Emperor's presence. The rest maintain a permanent vigil throughout the labyrinthine corridors and chambers of the Imperial Palace.\n\nThe Adeptus Astra Telepathica\nThe Adeptus Astra Telepathica is an important branch of the Adeptus Terra—the organization responsible for training and controlling all sanctioned human psykers within the Imperium. Only Astropaths have the power to send telepathic communications across the void between stars. Without psykers, interstellar communications would be impossible. Tech-Priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus have never succeeded in developing instantaneous communications technology.\n\nThe Adeptus Mechanicus\nThe Adeptus Mechanicus are the guardians of Earth's most ancient knowledge. Only they understand how to maintain and construct the technological marvels upon which the Imperium depends. They alone offer technologically sophisticated machinery needed within the Imperium. The Adeptus Mechanicus is as much a scientific body as a religious organization, and its knowledge of technology remains sacrosanct.\n\nThe Adeptus Astartes\nThe Adeptus Astartes, commonly known as Space Marines, are genetically engineered superhuman warriors organized in a thousand Chapters spread throughout the Imperium. They stand as Mankind's foremost defenders against the perils of the void. Over the millennia, this faith has evolved and for countless billions, the Emperor is nothing less than a god. The Adeptus Ministorum, known as the Ecclesiarchy after its chief high priest, the Ecclesiarch, represents the most powerful religious organization dedicated to the worship of the Emperor. Most powerful among the Ecclesiarchy's forces are the Adepta Sororitas, also known as the Sisters of Battle."

The Administratum divides the Imperium into five primary administrative regions known as Segmentae Majoris. These are the Segmentum Solar, Segmentum Pacificus, Segmentum Obscurus, Segmentum Tempestus, and Segmentum Ultima.\n\nSegmentum Solar contains Holy Terra and is the most heavily fortified and defended region of Imperial space. The Segmentum Pacificus lies to the galactic west of the Segmentum Solar, while the Segmentum Obscurus occupies the region to the galactic north, containing the Eye of Terror. To the galactic east lies the vast Segmentum Ultima, the largest administrative region. South of the Segmentum Solar lies the Segmentum Tempestus.\n\nThese Segmentae are further divided into sectors, each comprising numerous star systems. The Calixis Sector, where Rogue Trader campaigns typically begin, is located on the rimward edge of the Segmentum Obscurus, at the border of the galaxy and the vast emptiness of the intergalactic void."

Once a collection of independent worlds, the Calixis Sector was forged into a cohesive stellar empire more than a thousand years ago through the military campaigns known as the Angevin Crusade.\n\nThe Calixis Sector contains many significant worlds, including the sector capital of Scintilla, the shrine world of Maccabeus Quintus, the hive world of Fenksworld, and the restricted death world of Dusk. Among the sector's other notable features are the Adrantis Nebula, the Hazeroth Abyss, and the Periphery Sub-sector.\n\nUnderlying the Calixis Sector's apparent stability is a web of corruption, conspiracy, and forbidden knowledge. The mysterious phenomenon known as the Tyrant Star, the heretical Logicians cult, and other hidden factions all threaten the sector's security. It is these shadows that provide fertile ground for Rogue Trader expeditions, where fortunes can be made by those willing to venture beyond the reach of Imperial authority.\n\nThe Koronus Expanse\nBeyond the Calixis Sector, across the vast rift known as the Maw, lies the Koronus Expanse, a region of lawless wilderness space. Here, Rogue Traders operate with minimal Imperial oversight, claiming worlds for the Emperor and their own profit. The Koronus Expanse contains countless unexplored star systems, lost human colonies, and alien civilizations ripe for exploitation by those bold enough to venture there."

Some regiments operate with a comparable level of technology, others have regressed to a more barbarous state of warfare. Each regiment draws upon the specific fighting style of their home world, creating a diverse force capable of addressing any mission, from external threats to internal rebellion. No human worlds are safe, as new threats are being discovered constantly, often outnumbering the Imperial forces by staggering numbers.\n\nRegiments raised from hundreds of thousands of worlds form the backbone of Imperial military might. Sometimes fighting alongside the elite Space Marines, more often fighting alone, forgotten for hundreds of years, the Imperial Guard stands eternal.\n\nTHE OFFICIO ASSASSINORUM\nThe Officio Assassinorum serves as the Emperor's secret weapon, eliminating important threats to the Imperium through carefully targeted assassination. Operating from hidden temples, the various assassination orders employ specialists trained in different techniques and technologies.\n\nTHE DOMAINS OF THE GOD-EMPEROR\nThe Imperium of Man stretches across much of the galaxy, the mainstay and strength of Humanity under the dominion of the Emperor. Spread throughout the entire galaxy, linked by the beacon of the Astronomican, vessels navigate the warp. The vast majority of the habitable worlds within the galaxy lie within the borders of the Imperium. The galaxy also contains many independent human planets or smaller empires ruled by humans. These empires are few, far from Terra, and technologically inferior to the Imperium.\n\nTHE INQUISITION\nThe Inquisition is among the most secretive and powerful organizations of the Imperium. Individual Inquisitors have the authority to investigate and root out any threat to Mankind within the Imperium's borders. These threats include heresy, mutation, rampant psyker activity, alien infiltration, and daemon cults.\n\nInquisitors operate without supervision or strict hierarchy, answerable only to their peers and, nominally, the Emperor Himself. Most often, they operate on the fringes beyond the light of the Astronomican, accompanied by a retinue of specialists, warriors, and savants to help them in their tasks. Even the High Lords of Terra fear to bring the scrutiny of the Inquisition upon themselves, as betrayal of the Emperor and Mankind is the ultimate crime.\n\nThe Halo Stars\nBeyond the borders of the Imperium lies wilderness space—a vast region three thousand light-years thick, containing hundreds of billions of stars. Only a tiny fraction of these systems have been explored, with whole areas of the galaxy embroiled in warp storms for millennia at a time. These less accessible areas are labeled wilderness space and remain largely unexplored and unmapped. Some systems are forgotten and obscured by distance, others rendered inaccessible by warp storms or galactic phenomena. Largely unknown zones are scattered throughout the galaxy, with many previously inaccessible regions far from Terra. The great colonization fleets of Humanity have spread throughout the galaxy, often separating more densely populated regions from each other by vast tracts of unexplored wilderness."

However, most are widely distributed over numerous worlds or remain either ignorant of spacecraft technology or possess technology of little interest to Humanity. Only a few alien races command technology that rivals that of the Imperium, though many alien species exist with minor technological advantages.\n\nPLANETARY GOVERNANCE\nMost worlds are governed by hereditary rulers unofficially called Imperial Commanders or Planetary Governors. These individuals hold the controlling rights over a planet or even an entire system. In return for his oath of loyalty and regular tithes, a Commander maintains total control of his world. These Commanders administer and defend each planet under their control.\n\nEach planet is responsible for its own defense; Imperial Commanders maintain and deploy ground-based defenses, often maintaining interplanetary spacecraft within their systems. The number of spacecraft and what defense fleets they maintain depends on the enthusiasm of its possessor. Though technically all civilian spacecraft belong to the Commander of the world, most worlds allow individuals to command their own vessels with proper authority.\n\nIn trouble spots or vulnerable portions of the galaxy, the Imperial Navy maintains substantial forces. With its size independent of the Imperial Commander, the Navy may also assist worlds in trouble if they can spare the vessels from their primary duties.\n\nPLANETS OF THE IMPERIUM\nThe worlds claimed by the Imperium of Man are as diverse as the galaxy itself. Generally, only those planets that can support human life are considered valuable enough to be settled, though even this includes worlds where humanity survives through sheer determination against nearly impossible odds. Such worlds are those with strategic value to the Imperium, perhaps for a vital resource or strategically vital location.\n\nAn ancient settlement might have been founded millennia ago and forgotten, its inhabitants evolved completely separately from the Imperium. Beyond classification according to which branch of the Imperium a world is most important to, worlds are categorized according to their general features. A world may be classified as a Hive World because of its enormous population density, or as a Forge World, Agri-World, Ocean World, or even Death World depending on its characteristics. Many worlds have no importance to the Imperium, lacking either the population or the resources the Imperium values."

Some hive worlds are entire ecospheres of vegetable, animal, and gaseous resources and Imperial Guard recruitment. In the hives themselves, even daily human life is a mishmash of interactions. These harsh places have been altered over centuries from massive urban concentrations called hives.\n\nRESEARCH STATIONS\nSome hives reach up to 10 miles in height; the principal population centers, factory mining, ammunition, chemical industry, utility processing industries, and over-populations are maintained by a high import/export ratio with the emplacements. Major facilities maintain imports of consumables and materials from Death Worlds or all other avenues possible for furthering research from manufacturer and domestication.\n\nAGRI-WORLDS\nMany farming worlds exist throughout the Imperium. They also serve Agri-Worlds and exist entirely to grow food. These worlds have excellent ecosystems and lush fertile soil with high populations spread across the planet's surface.\n\nFEUDAL WORLDS\nAcross the Imperium, feudal worlds exist with low-technology levels similar to ancient Terra. With the constant supply from higher Imperial sources, some Agri-Worlds almost entirely survive winter-hardships according to feudal actions and ancient structures. These thinly populated worlds rely on a single company of tech-priests which extracts resources from the world, with limited direct contact. Post-black powder technological history on such worlds might remain at the feudal level for many centuries if decreed. The rise of society might have begun on such worlds through militarism.\n\nCIVILISED WORLDS\nWorlds following both feudal patterns and other forms of planet-wide organization are listed in this category, though the term includes worlds at all technological levels similar to the bulk of worlds not touched by outright war. Civilised Worlds generally represent Earth's historical population levels across centuries.\n\nFORGE WORLDS\nForge Worlds defend themselves against most other worlds. Though they might interact more than other worlds, Forge Worlds are the sovereign domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Categorised as Cardinal Worlds, Garden Worlds, Mining Worlds, or various other specialized worlds, they take the form of planet-wide factories. Most utilize vast resources to forge combat vehicles for the Legions of the Imperium.\n\nDEAD WORLDS\nDead Worlds are ideal for the supply of mankind around the galaxy. The intrinsic combat forces with worlds with mineral, atmospheric or gaseous resources often make Forge Worlds turbulent.\n\nLANGUAGE\nAvailable throughout the Imperium.\n\nOn almost every civilized world of the Imperium, the population regularly communicates daily while using High Gothic for formal communications. Imperial Gothic, Low Gothic, or Common is the human language used by virtually the entire populace of the Imperial worlds. While multiple accents might be present, Low Gothic is a trade vehicle allowing two individuals from different worlds to communicate.\n\nDEATH WORLDS\nDeath Worlds similar to World Callasinia exist which present greater than normal hazards. Although first settlements might be extremely perilous, Low Gothic remains prevalent for survival. Death Worlds are often incomprehensible to proper human attitudes - Catachan worlds with threatening volcanoes and wracked by poison flora. They require further study. Master works established colonies at great effort, using colonists especially trained to survive such worlds."

Originally translated through ministration, literary expertise and scholarly pursuit, Low Gothic remains universal.\n\nWhile Low Gothic can, and has been perverted and changed, the Imperium won't allow the Mutants to take control of planets or groups of planets. Each civilization requires its own translation. In-system vox-nets allow educated individuals in cities where electro-linguistic coils maintain contact with the Imperium.\n\nHigh Gothic, also referred to as Principal Gothic or Archaic Gothic, should be suppressed. However, most educated minds recognize Gothic. High Gothic is the ancient, unchangeable, sacred language used in evaluation of holy portions of essential documentation.

Having virtually entire dominion, partially known or widely rumoured mutation, a ritualized presence through education agreements are present for different cultures.\n\nABHUMANS\nDoom collectively constrains the common idea. Another telltale element is the Technical-Priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Abhumans are creatures that evolved from humans yet differ outside of accepted degrees. They differ from mutants in that they conform to a recognizable physical standard that persisted for millennia. Virtually integrated into the Low Gothic of highly technologically oriented cultures, few outside the Mechanicum can fully comprehend elaborate Tech-Priest rituals. Specialized references and technical terms are extended through the Adeptus Mechanicus.

Aged Technology, recorded into Anthology-vessels though not part of the original Warhammer Mutants, have lost sanctioned manuals. Tech-Priest hierarchies and protocol Hierarchs placed within vocal shrouds restrict other humans.\n\nCULTURE\nTrade in the Imperium.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nIn a galaxy of planets, most populous worlds are far apart. The only means possible for interstellar distances are staggering. Countless subcultures have attended to the Astropaths. Astropaths enable sending messages nobody else could handle. Very few require telepathic means to check Deceive-scribe communications with other Astropaths. Near warp contact (power maintenance) directly outside of the mainstream Astropath organization requires unusual dedication. Each world has its own culture, distinguished by their traditions and language. Those who maintain flowing housecare tradition require personal touch. Upbringing for priests' traditions, their Aldis, mankind's immediate translation facilities and robot-teachings allow Imperial Astropaths across the galaxy ship hold patterns communicated.\n\nMUTATION\nImperial faith, the Inquisition, and Adeptus Ministorum colonization are populations' strongest allies. Throughout the Imperium, Administratum has been supporting populations with dangerous systemic environmental conditions. Consequently some worlds understand certain mutations with populations with distinctive physical traits such as tattooing, cosmetic adaptations, and others. Details of physical genetic information can spread amongst the Adeptus Astra Telepathica procedures. Man's populations that are near maximum deformity develop mastery of mental mutation the Inquisition considers too dangerous for Imperial control. Jets penetrate worlds' already-thin atmosphere. Resettlement Authorities collaborating with other designs for salvation - the Imperial Trust. Imperial vessels and Astropaths are part of civilian worlds. On primitive worlds they are rarely spoken of. Modern commerce with advanced technology customs prevail on civilized worlds with interstellar mutants born near mining communities, living as outcasts. Navigators, the body of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, makes up two subject domains - worlds thus segregated.

It is often described as a reflection of our reality, where the psychic emanations of mortals reshape its landscape. The Warp touches all points in realspace equally, making it possible for properly equipped vessels to shorten journeys that would otherwise take centuries.\n\nWARP CREATURES\nWarp creatures are entities that inhabit the chaotic realm of the Warp. These horrors are typically confined to the Immaterium, but they still present significant dangers to vessels traveling through the Warp. Many ships drifting through the galaxy are more than empty hulks; they are haunted by predatory entities extending into the material realm.\n\nFeeding upon the life force of the ship's inhabitants, these entities exert malignant influence and can turn humans insane by their unwholesome presence. Some beings possess physical forms; others can emerge fully physically into realspace through the ship itself, while sometimes murder-destruction happens without visible cause.\n\nDaemonic entities often nearly manifest when a ship's Gellar Field collapses. These entities exist in the Warp and give the most terrible nightmares to those who encounter them. Many ships' defenses against such horrors collapse when their Gellar Field generators fail. Feeding upon the life force of the ship's inhabitants but also maintaining themselves at a strategic level, these entities extend their influence across the material worlds during the breakdown of Warp-real space barriers.\n\nWARP PORTALS\nWarp portals are stable passages that bridge between realspace and the Warp. Where stable interfaces exist, a portal forms a stable entrance into and exit from the Warp. Imperial authorities must constantly monitor these portals, sealing and destroying them where possible. Any vessel not equipped with proper warp-weakening technologies cannot survive within the Warp. Spacecraft entering a portal without sufficient protection would be immediately destroyed.\n\nCROSSING THE VOID\nThe most common form of transport between worlds involves normal space travel. The ships of the Imperium would be helpless without technology and equipment to protect them from the void. Vast fleets transport armies and officials across Imperial space, serving as the repositories for carrying vital materials, goods, weapons, and humans.\n\nHive worlds and civilized worlds within the Imperium rely on these vessels. Whether long-range cargo haulers, privately owned merchant vessels, or military craft, these ships enable the Imperium's survival. The Imperial Navy maintains fleets numbering thousands of warships varying in size; in addition to spaceships the Navy retains countless mining and refining ships, exploration and research satellites, orbital factories, and countless small craft cruising the void."

Although not large in numbers, they are among the most ferocious and highly trained warriors in the galaxy. Each Chapter is self-sufficient and maintains its own vessels including supply dumps in solar systems. It would be foolish to include their ships into the sector fleets.\n\nSpace Marine Chapter Masters are given jurisdiction within their own sectors and markings, and their rules are law among their ranks. Individual Space Marine Chapters often modify or customize their own vessels. An Imperial Commander may take immediate control of shipping if it suits operational needs.\n\nThe illegal interstellar trader's greatest enemy is technology. It is also owned by individuals or companies. Interstellar families make up only a tiny fraction of the total shipping concerned with interstellar commerce. Most noteworthy are vessels permitted to operate in the rimward zones of the Imperium. Commonly, most great families finally establish their pirate bases within uninhabited systems.\n\nPIRATE SHIPS\nPirates operate exclusively against registered shipping; others may also attack unregistered trade vessels. These ships are dangerously armed and well built for operation inside the system. The chances a sub-stellar craft will have any armed defense against pirates are low. Pirates usually attacking within a four light-year range of inhabited systems, mainly against sub-stellar craft belonging to their enemies.\n\nILLEGAL SHIPPING\nThe Imperium is large, large enough to hide really hordes and bands of humans though the Administratum has a great deal of control. Cargo vessels would be randomly inspected under normal circumstances, but when illegal shipping does occur, interstellar black market trade would be the incentive. They unregistered ship would automatically be recognized as illegal.\n\nENEMY RAIDERS\nRaiders interstellar belonging to alien races are a considerable threat since Imperial Commanders are prone to quarrel with corrupted Tech-Priests of neighboring fleets. In these cases, one side prepared for defense against the other. They may utilize illegal ships for reconnaissance missions at relatively slow speeds, but they are few and far between. Such fights occur mainly against sub-stellar craft belonging to heathen worlds around with contested borders.\n\nUNREGISTERED SHIPS\nCompared to registered shipping, illegal ships are very few. Planets all have local laws governing what comes in and out. The import duty or tax, complex quarantine laws, colonial administration divisions or the movement of heretical ships - all are prohibited within a sector. Fleet networks must be maintained within the galaxy.\n\nTHE SEGMENTAE MAJORIS\nThe Imperium is divided into five fleet zones known as Segmentae Majoris. Although intended for purposes of fleet administration, the colonial administrative divisions of the Segmentae Majoris have become substantially more important over the centuries. Each Segmentum has its dominant sector centers which give Segmentum Commanders authority within the Segmentum over people, including civilian elements controlled by commercial factors. Landing fees, route duties, and taxes controlled by Segmentum forces are only among the various revenues collected by the Adeptus."

Each merchant ship operates under control of a civilian Admiral for that sector called the merchant Captain. No charters are made unless connected to Fortran Conclave but they merely make recommendations for the fleet authorities on behalf of the Emperor, requiring his vessel be registered.\n\nSUB-SECTORS\nSectors are divided into sub-sectors usually comprising between eight and twenty inhabited star systems within eight light-years of each other. This size is governed by Fleet Charter, the least prestigious level of interstellar mandate. A Fleet Captain may determine which worlds do or do not fall within his zone. These worlds are often feature uninhabitable worlds.\n\nTHE STELLAR FLEETS\nThe Imperium's interstellar fleets comprise vessels that they wish within the five Segmentae, that they specialize for established routes connecting into specific areas.

Charter ships can only enter another Segmentum with special permission of the fleet authorities. Any Hereditary Captain can be simply recalled.

In fact, some of the oldest Rogue Trader families claim that their Warrants were signed by the Lord of the Emperor Himself, though most keep such documents safe from prying eyes and hiding them well like the rosette carried by Inquisitors, a poor copy of a Trader's authority. Documents of such value are so rare that few if any Rogue Traders openly show their original papers to middling bureaucrats claiming to be Trader and demanding of unsuspecting Imperial Commanders all of the rights that come with the title.\n\nThe Imperium is a feudal society in which all individuals know their station and rarely dare question their betters. And where there are those who learn their rights, from Inquisitors and Imperial Commanders down to the meanest void-captain, many figure out very quickly just who they are dealing with. Some may claim to be something they are not, but it is normally better to assume that the fellow with the fancy robes, vast grin, hundreds-strong retinue, and large fleet of ships making orbit over your palace is in fact a duly appointed representative of the Imperium. The alternative might be worse.\n\nBACKING\nUpon receipt of a Warrant of Trade, a Rogue Trader might be granted command of significant military and mercantile assets directly by the highest levels of the Imperium, but usually they must be provided by backers with interest in the Rogue Trader's profit; many Rogue Traders owe a portion of their profits to noble patrons. Rogue Traders conveniently forget all about this when they pass beyond the Imperium's reach, though these explorers may well find substantial rewards placed for their subsequent capture.\n\nRogue Traders are skilled diplomats who can conduct cordial talks with alien races, or become hardened killers when the situation demands it. Rogue Traders are viewed as susceptible to all kinds of heresies because of their regular contact with alien civilizations and their hangers-on. With philosophical sanction for wealth, committing such crimes as trading with alien markets might lead to serious confrontation among the Rogue Trader's rivals. Particularly if the Rogue Trader appears within a highly visible personality. Despite these occasional differences among their own kind, most Rogue Traders often die unrepentantly.\n\nTHE WARRANT OF TRADE\nEach captaincy has his own style and manner. They carry authority. By dint of the fact that the Warrant gives traders unique weapons, equipment, and overall control over the Segmentum Fortress, the Imperium itself depends largely upon their goodwill. Even to some degree, control over movement among merchant vessels has the Imperial permission. For such reasons, the region of the galaxy it lacks discrete borders and intensive examination. When surveying the region during vast areas, millions of empires exist in Wilderness Space; the populations engaging in Rogue Trader worlds intermix with alien cultures, trading with high ranking members of the Adeptus might be common as a part of Imperial aristocratic elements who, normally, remain extremely unwelcoming. Imperial officials often sorting contracts from non-Imperial culture. Caught from birth amid military regiments, trained to serve Mankind, educated remotely, feeling that contact with outsiders brings pollution, most avoid anything remotely resembling xenophilia. Contact with Rogue Traders leads to Imperial space becoming contaminated with proscribed culture or forbidden ancient teachings that are not sanctioned.\n\nDuring the darkest periods, High Lords of Terra and their duly appointed proxies were struggling amid rebellion against the Imperium. Though the High Lords can no longer issue Warrants beyond the Imperium, they are still required to approve anyone granted a Warrant of Trade. Issued in the Holy name of the Emperor, this document grants only the permission to build upon the Rogue Trader's capital influence beyond the Imperium's borders, deal with xenos races who are deemed benign, interact with heretical human settlers, who themselves have drifted away from the Adeptus track, and engage in trade. This vague wording allows the Rogue Trader to prosper in many unusual ways."

      "text": "THE BATTLE OF JADE REACH\nDuring the Imperial Navy crisis with Commander Crenshaw's detention in the Segmentum Pacificus, the Calixian Fleet commanded by Captain Kirstan and her squadron of escorts operating outside of the Scarus Sector, the flotilla intercepted an Astropathic distress call from Romany Mechanicus survey vessel and diverted to investigate. As Captain Kirstan and her small escort arrived, detecting a significant Ork cruiser. Although the distress call mentioned only battle cannon fire, her ships later determined that this was a deception. The unmistakable border defense of the Ork raider class vessels were breaking into the zone while Captain Zenith's flotilla engaged forces waiting for the Emperor's Grace. The Orks got distracted within minutes when the attack broke through. This action has entered Munitorium archives as a prime example of determined resistance and prowess among Imperial vessels.\n\nThe Imperium has awarded many who serve the High Lords. The Imperial Commander position allows many illustrious heroes the highest of ranks to be considered equivalent to their contemporaries, which might make drastic differences with how to exact methods of tactics might run contrary to the classic military doctrines of space combat taught at the Segmentum Fortresses. Space Marine Chapter Masters are granted power to deal with such parts of the Imperium as equals and the privilege to call upon what aid they require from the field forces. While the Warrant of Trade confers upon the recipient those with genuine talent for exploring beyond the Imperium that the Imperium could never fully endorse; might achieve great things at the borders of the Imperium that the power released from the strict battle hierarchy of the Warrant brings.\n\nMany within the Imperial Navy and most importantly within established power structures of the Imperium have Rogue Traders debate endlessly about whether Warrants should exist. And indeed, at times, they might all agree with the customs of the Imperium and many individuals; they served beside the Emperor Himself beyond those borders. Such sworn comrades of aid when really needed.\n\nFurthermore, the Warrant of Trade grants tremendous rights to its recipient, allowing him to collect whatever he needs from Imperial citizens and sell it on his own terms. This provides aid when desperate. Many Rogue Traders act with extreme prejudice and rule what they get. Many contact recently conquered or primitive planets; colonial individuals or any Imperial Commander would deem this outwards the high admiral and therefore a even greater aim.\n\nRogue Traders from many worlds maintain the trappings of their former manner, themselves displaying roles and establishing the foundation for powerful noble lines similar to that worn by admirals (even if he had never attained rank) complete with medals and honors and gold-braided rescue cords. The roots of being a Rogue Trader motivate, but all are exceptional individuals who either through original ambition or fashion of some fearful world tribal chief allies themselves to the service of the Imperial creed. Alongside Navis Nobilite, mighty circles of humanity, they might embrace unknown unmapped traditions that appear feted or cursed; the Imperial rankings supporting them both through honor and the war of a hundred battlefields.\n\nTHE IMPERIAL NAVY\nTHE IMPERIAL GUARD\nRogue Traders meet the Imperial Guard among adventurers. This is hardly surprising; they are expected to command entire armies and ships. Those who have had actual combat experience and formal training sometimes serve in regiments during planetary operations. The possibility of meeting Guard might warn Rogue Traders, exceptionally skilled captains outside beyond the borders of the Imperium, space and their vessels giving a unique outlook. These Rogue Traders encounter enemies the likes of which ground-based combat initiated like most Militarum soldiers never face. Most combat recoil life among great generals rarely achieves exceptional status through untamed wilder places. Naval ships transport troops and likely charge into field battles as bold explorers."

Unlike those of a martial background who command their fleets from the front line, the political animal works behind the scenes after their deployment. Recent publications exist on how commanders should exert their power when creating battle plans—scheduled tactics within the dark realm of military might. Political maneuvering frequently benefits Rogue Traders and officers who prefer the center of intrigue. Rogue Traders may find themselves negotiating with alien veterans for mutual assistance or political alliances. Many monks toil to practice high rituals of Imperial protocol for combat encounters. Other more martial commanders keep themselves quietly withdrawn. House warriors demonstrate profound independence, bonding fiercely closely unto themselves who know best how to survive.

It is he who may walk the path of alien culture without harm.\n\nTHE FOLLY OF THE PREFECT MAJORIS OF DALTHUS\nWhen the Rogue Trader Lady Sun Lee was invited to attend negotiations between both parties to settle differences, neither would have believed that Han Aoein would ultimately fund the mining world of Dalthus. Despite his dislike of xenos, the diplomat was ultimately victorious in understanding what the Famoiscan Watch had been attempting for years.\n\nThe diplomat applies his considerable persuasive talents often upon first contact. Unlike the militant commanders who will open fire first and open negotiations later, the diplomat extolling the glory of the Imperium is ultimately the secret to success. Even Master Rule Millin can \"see reason\" and enjoy the established first contact. This makes a world's rulers more at ease into panic, believing the Imperium is benevolent.\n\nTHE PSYCHOPATH\nSome individuals harbor within themselves something dangerous and wild. Regardless of their background or personality type, each subject is potentially drawn toward the extermination of anything new and different. We would be remiss to exclude certain individuals from the universe as Mankind ventures further into the Galaxy.\n\nA known example would be Lord Tech-Adept Utma who presided over the planet's Prefect Majoris mining facility. Hitting and torturing the workers under Lady Sun Lee's unpredictable mission, subordinates for the slightest misdeeds would occur. More likely, he will seek to suppress such cultures and undermine their future interactions with the Imperium, no matter the potential loss.\n\nMany of these individuals are highly unpredictable who will make it their custom to establish hostile relations with every alien culture they encounter. They deal with those they come into contact according to their own prejudices. Governor Zee 9715 is a fortune. He disappeared soon after, unable to cope with human force near the continent into savage clans. Even capricious and unpredictable leaders are subordinate to the Imperium's mandate.\n\nTHE DIPLOMAT\nThe diplomat seeks to extend the influence of the Imperium forged through power. The diplomat encompasses the task of dealing with such alien empires of Mankind's space, mediating the rising conflicts amongst the stars, expecting all manner of grand receptions and official welcomes. They seek simply to work with other races, particularly those outside the Imperium.\n\nCommunication with alien races must be tolerated, even supported, while the enemies of mankind are crushed beneath the Imperium's boots. Skilled at waging war and negotiating with even the most belligerent adversaries, the diplomat works amongst the stars, content to treat with other races of the Imperium, sharing wisdom and knowledge about them even though they know alliances made with the Imperium are tenuous at best."

Prestigious Adminstratum factors provide specialized ships for operational use. Skilled command generates equal wealth for Man from family lineage output. Together, authorities would not (or not often) investigate pirate attacks.\n\nThe Imperium expects great things of Rogue Traders. Consequently, they are equipped for the dangerous mission they will face, accompanied by legions of enforcers. We of necessity rely on a needed minimum not reported. Those who emerge as champions would be qualified as crucial leaders of Imperium's frontiers.\n\nWhen facing the vast regions of uncharted space, they must learn the skills needed.

He was investigating what Imperial records called \"Sector Juno.\"\n\nDuring his voyage, each discovery where human blood had been spilt upon the planets seemed when the previously unnamed system returned. For reasons never fully determined, Drub also tasked with crushing their old and overall colonies received assistance from many different Space Marine Chapters. Drub had the authority to determine where the Space Marines would fight.\n\nFettie remembered when the vessels arrived. Seeking their primary attack force immediately, they encountered a formidable enemy. Drub's vessels suffered severe damage, even though the Astartes were able to hunt the xenos flagship and fleet, continuing battle to devastating effect. The remaining alien vessels reached the borders.\n\nThe Space Marines accompanied Drub to the colony itself and discovered a scene from nightmare. The colony remained a mere three hundred humans according to logs; xenos cuts and alien colonists remained aboard surviving equipment. Dog Die, it seems, had seen technological evidence that these alien felidae cyborgs had not been the last of their forces.\n\nThe traitors' curious existence killed more commonly within the system, leaving only their most well-equipped technology. Certain groups within the Administratum seem determined to track down and destroy all evidence honoring the Imperium, thereby punishing those who disgrace mankind's rightful place in the galaxy.\n\nCONDITIONS\nAll Warrants will be burdened with various conditions. Displayed hand-signed and sealed by Imperial edict, this all for show; these trappings of title intended to remind all worlds' leadership what a Rogue Trader fleet might be. They may fashion that the Imperium still exists far beyond their home worlds.\n\nLofty titles and the Warrant of Trade come with a number of conditions attached to it. It would be a mistake for the Rogue Trader to believe these conditions mean nothing. An individual bearing virtually unlimited authority in remote locations and high-level autonomy must accept many roles. The attached conditions serve to remind them that they stand as ambassador of the Imperium. The Imperial Commander of most worlds gets himself killed serving beyond their concerns.\n\nDealing with particularly small kingdoms, geo-questions about humanity must be explored without direct military intervention. Most conditions discussed and agreed are treated as royalty and given every assurance that any smallhold in the future clearly might visit. Empire innocently destroyed because the governor permitted settlement of alien races will be made right.\n\nTROOPING THE COLOURS\nSome common condition under which a Rogue Trader's either human or particular world visited by the Rogue Trader is displaying certain Imperial compliance. If a world has been policted for some time, a Rogue Trader is tasked to launch a punitive strike against revolt.\n\nPUNITIVE STRIKE\nNormally, after prolonged contact with a distant sector, pressing concerns have diverted attention; then where a long-running mission has proved unsuccessful, practical Administration must handle worlds that have rejected the rule of the Imperium.\n\nImperial squadrons must make this their primary target. Instead, Traders' forces must swiftly and effectively reclaim newly captured worlds. A Rogue Trader can squander their fleet when the rebellious world mentions the first breach of the economic bargain.\n\nIt has happened before; once often used to demonstrate their futility in sporadic non-violent concerning further lance strikes from orbit often hurt revolutionary movements that have Traders using military measures to reduce revolting weakening the governor's army undertaking combat operations into complete destruction.\n\nAlternatively, if ordered by the Imperial Commander might launch total atomic bombardment; his Warrant the destruction of luxurious cities is fully authorized."

      "text": "ONE MAN'S JUNK IS ANOTHER MAN'S FORTUNE\nRogue Trader Razhik Kin was accompanied by Mechanicus Explorators led by Master Hectihuc. His discoveries moved Kin to act first skeptical until he met the measure of his contemporaries.\n\nSoon discovered that the attentions of the Explorators to Komnarcy Kin were entirely fixated upon acquisition of pre-Imperium human artifacts and that they would often ignore or reject items of alien origin. Kin collected the Explorators' leavings.\n\nOver the centuries, Kin amassed an impressive collection of alien artifacts and, finding himself wealthy beyond his wildest dreams, Razhik Kin returned to the Koronus Expanse with several vessels to track down the explorators and rescue his harvest of their cast-offs. It is assumed that during his voyage collecting the rest and robbing tombs, Kin's exploits might be worth studying as an example.\n\nRECLAMATION\nProtracted rebellion might involve danger. Worlds proven sufficient resource-rich often must be brought back into the fold by the application of overwhelming force. Rogue Traders often demolish these power structures quickly, selecting Imperial governors to quell any lingering resistance. Gone entirely, the common practice demands immediate military censure. Administrative protocols of all colonial missions control personnel being selected according to Intelligence.\n\nOn such lost worlds might conflict with those who hunt remaining spaces. Mechanicus traders accounts report older classified intelligence can cruise the field with militant readings ensuring and for such missions, additional military forces might be seconded to his command.\n\nSETTLEMENT\nSettlement works in the name of the God-Emperor. These are immediate tasks the Adeptus administrate. Exploration Warrants of Trade might compel the fleet usually for a short time only, but pioneer fleets focus attention on Imperial workers in the galaxy; relentlessly recording compliant habitable worlds established through evidence.\n\nIntended military intervention expressly to work proves invasive. Fleet personnel decide what human endeavors work. Frequently, explorers put aside their military roles and un-make civilizations. When \"Generations follow up as they will\" appears within the mission reports, through dominant Administratum centuries before finally emerging into known shipping lanes, most of Humanity time-honored exploration brings settlement.\n\nCivilized planets IV must construct a fortress world for defense. Any high radiation planets may surface to radioactive dust; so alien life has claimed worlds not in-known entire systems.\n\nRogue Traders may orbit over such a world only to finally encounter other human colonies. Not uncommon electronic maintenance places need colony supplies initially. Much better-planned colonies might receive whatever they can or else colonization abandonment ensures. Hunting more than remains very small indeed. Fleet meeting small bands of human stragglers must range widely."

They themselves will not receive the exploitation rights they normally enjoy over the regions they explore.\n\nSuch units and an administrative body will be formed, often titled Military Sector Authority. Though they maintain the result, the more debited until the best use of the fleet's assets may decide upon possession. Implications remain until the diplomatic skills of the Rogue Trader connect more worlds which, although incomplete, succeed in adding to the worlds occupied by individuals.\n\nThe place once Military Governor otherwise desirable controlled over Imperial Commander. Imperial law must guarantee distinction where Guard serve alongside Space Marine forces. Long-lost archival records might suggest that faction found will succeed to own resources. Pioneer settlers will extract world order's provisions from alien tomb worlds pre-dating Imperial foundation's malignant disposition.\n\nSubhuman xenos might represent challenging discoveries. Once deployed, loyal guard forces understand familiar tech-Priests particularly are disgusted by planet-based super-weapons placed by aliens miles high, looming fighting those of more bureaucratic official mechanized existing civilizations.\n\nAll of these things might trigger expeditions such matters military advisors present. From dominion over gifted militias accompanied by Tech-Priests critic regiments, senior members Adeptus Mechanicus members may concern their domain. Many of them seeking to harvest technology have filled entire ships from the minds of the crude as if to claim resources for their own ends.\n\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE WARRANT\n\nEXPLORATION\nAt first glance it appears that some newly appointed Rogue Traders might be tempted to simply sail away to the great unknown without checking any of their obligations toward the safety of the Imperium's authorities since it presents a lot of resolve which a willful might come from. Yet many exploratory missions have found out that the remaining warrant parts contain obligations which strictly define what the Imperium expects from them."

      "text": "THE REWARD OF GALFIT\nTREACHERY\nA Rogue Trader complies with the conditions of his Warrant. Powerful representatives of the Imperium must ultimately make sure the conditions are maintained. This might be either the Imperium's authorities, Administratum services, or the Inquisition.\n\nThe price suffered by those who ignore their obligations is severe. On occasion, Trader Lord Galfit of the Line of Magnum proved this. During his illustrious career, accompanied by encounters with Rogue Trader Lord Galfit, he served numerous Space Marine vessels. These exceptional wars demonstrated and had reminded that the conditions are made for countless powerful enemies among the Calixis Sector to enforce the power of the Imperium.\n\nOn occasion, more clandestine means were engineered. Sometimes, the Rogue Trader Companies might have prominent representatives expecting him. Directed by more noble means which the promise of his authority and afford them the revenge they had long hoped for. Three years after Galfit's flotilla penetrated the Koronus Expanse into a world that the Imperium had quietly denied, the merchant vessels and inhabitants commenced to perpetuate lingered memories and discarded miscounsel.\n\nContact with Galfit's fleet might also lead to contingency plans. Nothing can escape pursuit. Merchant ships were safely protected. It was only when Adeptus Lieutenant Wavy found an unknown loot and the fleet entered the Samael Gate that the Anima Hope, allegedly discovered by Rogue Trader Sentinel, was non-compliant. General Akis-Harretch authorized direct contact with the ship's cells. A cybernetically altered corpse was discovered. The surgical techniques used on Galfit's body seemed straight from a Tech-Priest's manual.\n\nLINEAGE\nThere are two broad classifications of Trader: those who have obtained a Warrant of Trade, and those who have inherited it from a forebear. If granted a Warrant of Trade within minutes of his house receiving the document, powerful single fleetboat had existed with successful individuals and houses will grow over the generations and become increasingly formidable. The head master of the Magenta Dynasty extends beyond House Winterscale. The house will hold the title and the Warrant.\n\nREVOCATION AND FORFEITURE\nYet if the deed predominantly with the line regular such Warrant-holding Rogue Trader becomes powerful that House Winterscale initially has been unable to come into conflict with those of the Imperium. Indeed, on their shoulders rests the freedom granted by the Warrant of Trade, the duty maintaining the Warrant, and conduct in the great void. Trader action to compel his lineage contains himself beyond the scope of his role. The authorities are not overlooking Trader expansion of the benighted regions beyond the stars. Particularly actions of the Trader are often viewed with glory.\n\nWard does get back to the Imperium. Since Rogue Trader houses become split in their interests and circumstances will stretch across many worlds, the past revocation of the Warrant of Trade had powerful consequences where the families have declined and Houses where the members with the authority had served those Rogue Trader lines. The senior members might equitably maintain privileges for some houses continued in rank while diminished state, slowly rebuilding their fortunes that remained with another have gained inheriting the Warrant through treason or proven witch lore.\n\nEMPIRE BUILDING\nInvariably maintain outward appearance respectable, directly following rumination charging across throughout the universe, noble Trader houses' families have amassed power that they have become minor empires, offspring while also furthering interest maintaining controlling entire beyound the house and containing feeble domains. This in itself is not contrary or outright rebellion against the Imperium after the granting of the Warrant of Trade; Rogue Trader hold support for their offspring also from custom of their rule. From Rogue Trader to Rogue Trader within those realms."

      "text": "WINTERSCALE'S REALM\nOne of the most explored and exploited regions, and one that has delivered both great riches and early death for the unwary in equal measure. Winterscale's Realm is defined by the Imperial Nobility, the Imperial Ministorum, and perhaps even the Holy Ordos. It is comprised of a few dozen scattered worlds amongst the darkness of the unknown. Rogue Traders have spent their lives in this Realm's breadth, finding and claiming its furthest reaches and riches. It remains unexplored and undermapped. Though a handful of Imperial worlds worth charted exist amongst Winterscale's Realm, most have been partially explored; these have proven rich with relics and treasures. Beyond the extremes of the Koronus Expanse elsewhere, battlegrounds have formed around the most precious archeotech. Some worlds even darkly whisper of abhorring the Emperor's light, their populations turned to maddened cults. Traders who might find those distant sands and noble bastions in the Calixis Sector and beyond think themselves fortunate, having their vessels secured upon hull for safe harbor within Winterscale's Realm."

      "text": "THE THOUSAND CHARTS\nNavigator charts gained from the Rogue Trader Gebreus Winterscale do not remain consistent. Many hundreds of Navigators clad in brazen armor because of the legendary wealth harbored within bulky, vulcanized rubber star charts of the jungle worlds. Among the most charted regions of the Koronus Expanse, Winterscale's Realm such wealth is mentioned in thousands of records - though these are wildly divergent. The pits between those charts thus indicate fecundity and ferocity of worlds along warp routes that are generally agreed to maintain the exploits of the Koronus Expanse. There are navigable routes crossing hazards of human outposts dissolving into empty craft brought back into Calixis Sector. Locals hold their melee weapons built by local artisans with fascinating filigree work. Landing craft beneath the surface are simply by-products of several expeditions into jungles. Rogue Trader Van Abulen, known for his charges through Winterscale's Realm, once sent to Port Wander exotic guns carved with dark xenos leaves. Exotic barks that seep combined minerals would reveal the thick yellow colors of the fungus as pale milk. The secrets that lie within Winterscale's exploits and the hidden thick creepers from the jungle beneath pale flesh, which often float within swelling tides like rich, needy teeth above the passing skeletons.\n\nBLOOD AND FALSE GOLD\nSwollen and engorged with riches, Winterscale's Realm attracts Rogue Traders, explorers and merchant concerns. All fellbeings are drawn through flesh markets towards fortunes that might be made. The Mollat six-legged stalkers the size of humans, like blood fiends, scuttle silent and invisible though the branches of the jungle. Their deeds have earned them considerable notoriety back into Calixis Sector because of their lethal nature. Few would ever welcome Rogue Traders since establishing surface habitation means certain death for miners who don't prepare for battle immediately.\n\nThe Lure of Beasts\nEvery fool who beholds the lights of Port Wander wants to seek his fortune. Many have chosen Winterscale's Realm and other lush jungle worlds following the rumors of the Presence. Giants and hideous creatures might dwell within dark places and lurking monsters would remain for generations perched upon their lofty nest.\n\nBURNSCOUR\nEvery inch of Burnsour's ferocious jungles are often hauled off the surface by hunters. Despite being \"burnt crisping down\" with orbital anti-plant bombs and toxic agents, the entire jungle was miraculously reformed within days. Dangerous wildlife ceaselessly reclaims territory once the price commanded by hunters becomes valued. Various beasts of Burnsour, Rogue Trader Hiram Sult found out through tales of pirates vanishing within its hungry jungles. Whispers of the things that stalk Burnsour's roaring stormy jungles and lurking within the dark mists have hindered many expeditions. Even experienced Rogue Traders still tremble when the mortal fangs pierce strange flesh; the monsters are somewhat prized. Such are the prices that discerning patrons will pay for dangerous creatures and exotic plants. Nothing seems too rare and nothing worth hunting holds any claim. Ophelia Kothar, Rogue Trader Captain, is rumored to have a hunter's guild."

      "text": "THE EGARIAN DOMINION\nMany technological terrors await those who venture into Port Wander's highest tiers of power within the distant Calixis Sector. Those hard-headed men could offer little comfort and much torment to those cursed dreamers that had brought them through void and dusty, war-torn worlds for nought. Material losses proved the truth of the tales; the burned and dead world of Egaria exists.\n\nSpeaking of the discoveries of Rogue Traders in search of more riches of Winterscale's Realm, several expeditions were recently conducted.\n\nTHE FOUNDLING WORLDS\n\"Hidden beneath the dust, many millennia of dreams remain. Our ivory worlds are crumbling.\"\n\nThe principal landscape of the Foundling Worlds contains desert planets. Watch closely; vacation worlds with lightly constructed habitats have been dashed when the ghost lights of false stars converge. Hundreds of meter-high crystal formations at the borders forbid most who venture there seeing that danger awaits. Desert plains are heavily claustrophobic for most people; locked dunes make navigating hellish. Venturing into the edges of burning deserts is hazardous; building material perishes.\n\nThe Foundling Worlds lie beyond the Cauldron. They somehow carry the Light of Egarian Dominion 80 cycles forward. Against further exploration, strange incidents and the haunts of fate; the Foundling Worlds cluster, although relatively close worlds, remain uncharted. Imperial administrators have notoriously determined through military forces that space around the Foundling Worlds contains severe warp distortions, and strange stellar phenomena.\n\nTHE MURDERED WORLD OF JERAZOL\nNothing remaining within Jerazol's atmosphere has tried to prove that human colonisation and exploitation after surviving route into the world occurred. Recent ruins appear fresh despite ancient construction. Those few endeavors to explore the wealth of the Foundling Worlds have met with microsonic death. Thunder arises despite clear skies. Royal rulers who once commanded Jerazol with towering power abandoned their population. Lost to the Storm became their epitaph.\n\nLOST TO THE STORM\n\"Many developed frontier colonies within the Foundling Worlds reportedly ceased all communications with the God-Emperor's faithful following voidship visitations. Chaos and anarchy once prevalent among civilian populations continued for centuries until all trace of deity or corruption was eradicated. Apocryphal records suggest that Jerazol alone remained. Other explorers near those storm-wracked stillness report finding scattered primitive humans whose dying wonders crashed amidst morass of ancient technology. Remarkable menace appears wherever their extraordinary settlements built by their forgotten ancestors arise. They have trained themselves to hide among desecrated monuments. Features resembling the Foundling Worlds' flows with primal beauty. Having studied Jerazol like lurking legends, those who ventured there perished. The unnameable madness covered the sandy landscape. Journey into Jerazol's hidden depths might reveal enormous atmospheric protection against something that does not wish its presence known.\" - Imperial Explorator Hermagus"

      "text": "CURSED ENDEAVOURS\nThe Eaters of the Dead\nIt is said by the pious that God's unknown Foundling Worlds are littered with the dead carcasses of unrepentant souls punished in the God-Emperor's sight; and the punishment manifests as the creatures within those stark derelict spires. Forgotten vessels for centuries' shattered outposts inhabited by creatures were destroyed by raiders from the warp. Corpses of the dead feral colonies swallowing the whole and stealing; many humans turned from the light of the Emperor. All were tainted. The world itself was pleasurable and beautiful beings, forming the belief among many who explore the Koronus Expanse that all Eden exists in the Foundling Worlds.\n\nThe Exiles had settled themselves with the false hope that rescue would come and then when they did not arrive, the tales grew older and more desperate. And still they battled one another. Their vague plans among Foundling Worlds became clearer with time, and they stripped supplies and food from others. The many clans placed themselves around Foundling Worlds - fortified bunkers and their predatory raids toward others that seemed valuable. Whenever contact was made, they would feed those most loyal first, then those who had been kind. And then those that they deemed unworthy, consuming human flesh - and they are always hungry. Some have visible hope as to what beacons that broadcast distress calls out into space might accomplish.\n\nGRACE\nFrom Astro-telepathic journals of Ventris Calphasia, survivor of the expedition from the Inferno's Child:\n\"Commander Georr circled and shouted by whirling clouds. Tom's own fear grew; I heard strange voices calling. We called back, hunting through mists and simple wilderness. Our transit became obscured by giants and hosts, tidal forces and amidst lightning and frozen hail. A strange landscape but recognizable surface form from distant memory.\"\n\nAstropathic escape broadcast from Grace's colony:\n\"Founded under the Prospero Guildsman Achilles by Rogue Trader Aspyce Chorda. From behind void shields, all Imperial nobility and the most incredible warriors within the Foundling World are retreating. Small prospecting motor-skiffs vanishing despite the beauty of the world. Colony established by Master Rogue Trader Wan Weiller made the Late 8th Century Tertiary Millennium station. The Iron Mist brings Imperial justice. The world Grace is still little covered in colony slime beneath cut earth. The last scraps of astropathic reports from Prospero Colony talked of people scurrying beneath the shadows harboring terrible loss.\"\n\nColony of Arrogance\n\"Refused whispered plans but retaliating against the Emperor; garbled astropathic broadcast noted about pale figures and hostile Rogue Trader Aspyce Chorda. The colonials were trapped within close quarters where metal plates etched with arcane images which had been ceremonially brought to INIQUITY. Reaching the edges of Winterscale's realm, the Cold Guild, guarded by armed ministers, entered depths of Port Wander. Rogue Trader Aspyce Chorda swarmed costs from material resources, accepting fugitive Mechanicum lords and giving them orbital platforms revealing abandoned life. Attack ships provided the exiles with protection. The Iron Masters of Iniquity world kept mountains rising from dark rock. The mountain lurks thousands of Mechanicum fabricator-lords who govern mankind's most ancient technologies. Such supplies ending."

      "text": "INIQUITY\nCommon voidfarers living near Iniquity and those who might encounter its accursed denizens with warp-touched mechanical limbs know that Iniquity sits at the boundaries of Winterscale's Realm. They whisper tales of xenotech tomb invaders; and its brutal society is split into fraternities bonded by blood. Demonic dominion of machines plagued by endless nightmares of heresy beyond control, of machine worship and sorcerers who delve into the depths beneath the mountain's lower corridors.\n\nSTARS AND COURSES UNCHARTED\nMost realize that Iniquity, harboring the mineral-rich rock despite thousands of lives lost to poisoned atmosphere when accidents occur, is uncharted territory. Indentured workforce toil endlessly around mining settlements which few have explored and survived. Places of immense religious significance within the region were each built to conform closely with their local customs. Some attempts may have been made by the Navigator Clans who first found paths into Iniquity to record navigational information about the region, but such information is highly inaccurate and likely to prove lethal to both Navigator and ship. It is obvious from the evil that flows through rumors and whispers near Port Wander that none dare venture into the Accursed Demesne with knowledge of its dangers. Though many have tried to return to the wildest parts of the Charnell Stars, they may find all access to the Accursed Demesne poisoned by warp storms.\n\nCHARNEL STARS\nLATHIMON'S DEATH\n\"Lost beyond those barren worlds and ancient regions, Lathimon's Death orbits a broken star. Feared by warp travelers who during ancient days were arrested in their ships for their crimes and jailed in remote stations as punishment.\" - Personal journals of Balisius Trench, Navigator\n\nThe corpse-embers of the Charnel Stars beckon explorers from the Foundling Worlds. Promising worlds await among distant darkness. No Rogue Trader is known to have found a route through Lathimon's Death orbits of other Caris Malficum entities through remote pathways. The secrets and relics that wait upon those ancient derelict hulls can threaten those explorers who might discover them. Having uncovered hundreds of forbidden vessels that have failed to penetrate into the Charnel Stars, many of them never recorded, vast cyclopean structures, columns and buildings spread across its darkened surface, seemingly unassailable to the dusts of time that cloak it. Only those where Navigator Clans, including House Visscher-Trecht, and the Inquisition, have left written journals remain.\n\nTHE ACCURSED DEMESNE\nPROCESSIONAL OF THE DAMNED\nIt is believed that all evil and corruption in the Koronus Expanse emanates from the Accursed Demesne - also called the Processional of the Damned. These are dark places amidst the Halo Stars, cursed places marked by roaming ghost-vessels and the ravening Ork fleets beyond understanding. Those Rogue Traders who face such dire existence are themselves marked."

      "text": "Many believe that what lies within the Processional of the Damned is a twisted and blighted void. Dying worlds circling bright and turbulent stars closer to the solar energies sit within the Processional. Orbital debris and countless space hulks and vessels maneuver across a region many thousands of light years across. The very air within the vessels might appear toxic to human travelers approaching the core. The Processional contains uncounted thousands of inhabited worlds, though many of them perished perhaps long before mankind traveled between the stars. Perhaps mankind was never meant to intrude. Ghosts and other warp-echoes orbit with the Processional.\n\nFrom the private journals of Rogue Trader Wrath Umboldt:\n\"We split ourselves about the vessel, some silently entering the outer sections. Many sought what the others had encountered. The ship void of the system remained pristine, yet its prefect vaults were seemingly disturbed. Meaning unknown, we concluded that hallucinations coated the walls and fled amidst unexplained circumstances. Despite warnings, Umboldt pressed onwards into the Processional, and his older crew tracked remnant age craft as if nothing were there. The Processional loomed ominously.\"\n\nUNDRED-UNDRED TEEF\n\"Art flows among the dead fleets that would crush our nebula and write bitter legends amidst the void. The veil is thin. Workers dream bright dreams; bold men travel these stars but never did return. Having followed the ash and sombre mist like monumental beings glanced into the Processional. Damned, lured into frozen furrows of cold darkness beyond stars and tants. Creation jumps clear with harsh tech-designs that weep like men, haunting remote distances.\"\n- Advisor to the Unknown, Mauritian, Rogue Trader Hiram Sult\n\nThe Undred-Undred Teef is a massive system within the Accursed Demesne that is the heartland and breeding ground of Orks. Only a few of the boldest, most foolhardy corsairs have ventured into this place, but those that survive speak of worlds held in empires thick and rich, ringed with clouds of debris from which Ork starships launch their brutal prows bristling with weapons. Beneath these mantles of scrap and crude defences are worlds poisoned by aeons of industry, on which the Orks constantly battle one another for dominance with devastating weapons. Competing tribes and mutant machine-entities crowd these worlds where the Orks mine fuel, smelt, build, and repair their weapons. The Orks within the Undred-Undred Teef surely form the largest clan outside of known space, and powerful individual Ork Bosses constantly battle to demonstrate their power. The most successful and powerful Bosses may one day follow minor WAAAGH!s into the Undred-Undred Teef. Ork-held worlds home many bold and arrogant creatures. This unknown Ork gathering WAAAGH! has terrorized the opportunities of the Koronus Expanse, though no one knows for certain why such a massive alien force gathers there."

We got da first win o' many!'\n\nRecently, Morkgaash Kulgraz has been making a name for himself among da Freebooterz, gathering other Freebooterz under his banner and establishing himself as the pre-eminent warlord in Undred-Undred Teef. Tell me what ya know about him?\"\n\n\"Morkgaash Kulgraz appeared in the Koronus Expanse heavily armed.\"\n- Sirted Fain, Stryxis Merchant Master\n\n\"Good space hulk, that one. Although barely spaceworthy, the hulk was filled with loot from other worlds.\"\n\nThe Stryxis are nomadic xenos with a reputation for being both crafty and untrustworthy traders. Wanderers and scavengers, they travel the stars before arriving at Undred-Undred Teef and encounter Freebooter Kaptin Morkgaash. Their reputation is a dark one. The Stryxis are truly hideous to look upon - the beginning of his rise to power.\n\nDuring ship combat, Morkgaash wrestled control of the largest and most powerful ship, described by onlookers as multi-screaming, colored cloth and trinket-wearing xenos that resembled humanoid plague dogs. Yet they communicate easily with normal throat sounds in a common language.\n\nMorkgaash then brought many Freebooter boyz from the other Kaptins, including those driven by curiosity and self-interest. Scavengers that they are, the Stryxis possessed what technology they could find. Morkgaash quickly adapted the technology gathered from the Stryxis. The Stryxis delight in trade, attaching no monetary value and apparently affected only by their own desires. They seek wealth forcefully from their victims, allowing hundreds to flee before attacking. Instead of killing quickly, the Stryxis buy their infamy through intrigues. This being said, they are not to be underestimated or seen as innocent. They can be extremely dangerous when it suits their capabilities.\n\nThe Stryxis are subtle liars and conceal dark intellects behind their eccentric behavior and obsession with trinkets and baubles. They will hesitate before dealing a crippling blow, plotting carefully so that their opponents perish when they least expect it.\n\nThe Stryxis claim they will trade with anyone. Though they maintain a fleet of ships of the Ruinous Powers, they despise the Eldar and Freebooter Orks without unified purpose. They will kill them if they can and they are clearly intelligent enough to do so.\n\nThe Orks dominate worlds within the Expanse, particularly around Undred-Undred Teef. The WAAAGH! contains an untold number of hollowed-out asteroids fitted with engines and advanced technologies. The worlds and vessels that these pirates inhabit contain relatively few adult Stryxis along with numerous slave races. The Ork Freebooterz have been getting more aggressive, becoming a dire threat to the Expanse.\n\nThe more Orks there are, the bigger and more powerful the leader becomes. The more powerful the leader, the more likely he is to attract Orks from other cultures. When at odds with their own force, the Stryxis will spin endless and often contradictory lies about the Orks of Undred-Undred Teef, but it may be that there is no supreme leader.\n\nDespite the infamy of Freebooter pirates in the Expanse, constant opposition impedes overall leadership of Undred-Undred Teef. Morkgaash is cunning and ambitious; his rise to power spans the Koronus Expanse and beyond. Through ruthless advantage, Morkgaash has become harder than all the other Kaptins, including the Flash Gitz, and it remains unknown how to separate the truth from the lies about Undred-Undred Teef."

      "text": "THE CHAOS GODS\nBeneath the fabric of reality lurks the Warp, a realm of unfathomable energies, maddening chaos, and malevolent entities. The Warp is inhabited by the Dark Powers - mighty and terrible intelligences formed from the darkness of the first millennium. These entities are a blight upon the galaxy and find fertile ground for their powers among those who whisper their dark names into heretical prayers.\n\nHowever, their influence is carried by champions of the foul gods, four of which dominate the benighted shadows - although there are many who choose to worship them as a combined pantheon of fell Chaotic powers.\n\nKHORNE\nTHE BLOOD GOD, THE SKULL LORD, THE HUNTER, THE LORD OF MURDER\n\nKhorne is the god of murder, rage, and war. His great brass throne sits atop a mountainous pile of bones rising from a sea of blood. He is the Hungerer, the Harbinger of War, and the Lord of Champions. His clarion call is the meat-rending explosion of a bolt shell. The Wrathful Icon is bellowed by his followers who exist only to harvest skulls for their dark lord.\n\nTZEENTCH\nTHE CHANGER OF WAYS, THE ARCHITECT, THE GREAT CONSPIRATOR\n\nTzeentch is the Chaos God of change, schemes, and sorcery, who twists fate and alters plans where ambition runs rife and war-like powers compete. Twisting his horned head like liquid smoke, Tzeentch is a master of paradoxes and master of intrigue. He bestows his followers with arcane power and horrific mutations.\n\nSLAANESH\nPLEASURE INCARNATE, THE PRINCE OF EXCESS, THE DARK PRINCE\n\nSlaanesh is the Chaos God of hedonism, sensation, and luxury. No pleasurable pursuit is too perverse for followers of the Golden-Haired God, who watches over the writhing flesh pits and ecstatic rites of his slaves. Under his gleaming gaze, all is permissible and none can resist becoming dedicated to whom they serve.\n\nNURGLE\nTHE LORD OF PESTILENCE, THE DESTROYER, MASTER OF PLAGUES, THE FAT LORD\n\nNurgle is the Chaos God of decay, disease, and entropy - Spreader of Disease and Father of Decay. Grandfather Nurgle welcomes all in his rotting embrace. His favours take the form of glorious pus-flowers, the marks of his favoured children. His raucous laughter echoes across the blasted battlefields of the Imperium with only the bloated corpses of the dead to hear.\n\nSLAVES TO DARKNESS\n\"Those who have become enthralled to the Gods of Chaos have forfeited their immortal souls. Their hearts belong to their dark masters, while their bodies are allowed to die a final death.\"\n- Proclamations of Inquisitor Ael, Ordo Malleus\n\nCHAOS PIRATES AND RENEGADES\nTempters and seducers lurk in the psychic energy called the Warp - the formless dark and dangerous intelligences formed from the darkness of the Koronus Expanse. The most terrible creatures are the pirates and renegades who plague the starships - vicious and deluded men whose hatred of the Imperium has led them into the worship of dark powers. Chaos beckons and they answer. Others hail from worlds beyond the Expanse, foolish enough to flee the light of the Emperor through the void. These deluded fools who have turned to Chaos are lost, seeking revenge against the Imperial forces that once pursued them."

      "text": "CHAOS SPACE MARINES\nChaos Space Marines are mighty warriors of the Adeptus Astartes who have betrayed the Imperium. Monstrous warriors using terrible weapons, they launch ferocious attacks against loyalist Space Marines and all defenders of humanity. They are renegades and traitors, terrifying warriors and the most feared servants of Chaos.\n\nRestless and dedicated, they travel the stars of the Koronus Expanse seeking new prey and enemies. Terrible visions of war-torn worlds plague them as they bring ruin to the innocent. Many Imperial servants have whispered that Chaos-tainted superhuman killers represent the servants of the Dark Gods - proud and blood-soaked lords who demand that lesser men bend their knees in subjection.\n\nIf this proves true, the danger these Chaos-tainted superhuman killers represent cannot be measured. The pirate domain of the Expanse has remained unchecked since the Age of Strife, plagued by marauded vessels whose holds are like slaughter houses for human cargo - renegade Imperial ships and mysterious vessels of unknown origin. Loyal to the Chaos Gods, these truly monstrous and merciless killers prey on shipping and isolated outposts. The claws and teeth of fully human cultists rend the dead, tearing open the hulls of passing ships and bringing their slave crews and corrupted servitors to terrible sacrifice and ritual slaughter.\n\nWitness the dread and slaughter beside the flesh-pocked patriarchs and matriarchs of the Clan, their finery scarred and fickle guidance cracked with dry sobs. Such is the reputation with blood and chains that pirates carry in the warp. The Sartar Clan are pirates and raiders whose very name causes other pirates and raiders to shrink in fear of their attention.\n\nThe Reavers of Karrad Vall\nThe ships of Karrad Vall hunt their larger quarry down like a pack of wolves - their particular cult on the Ruinous Powers ventures into the Koronus Expanse. No one has ruled Vall, his ships having been visited by daemons, but the barbed prows of his ships and the baying of his crew are terror enough. Bound together by loyalty to their cult rather than to their captain, before Karrad Vall the charismatic individual who formed the cult, these were only disparate Freebooters and pirates. Lord whispers say that Vall was once an Adeptus Astartes captain.\n\nMany warriors serve the power of Chaos in the hopes of the Dark Gods, whilst others cynically believe that Chaos is something they can use to help achieve their own ends. Trusted Admiral Wartencale of Battlefleet Calixis was corrupted and destroyed when rumors persisted that Karrad Vall braved the Maw, promptly attacking from within. His massive fleet tore through the defenses that rose against them. When Vall departed, the stinking ruins burned in his wake before disappearing without a trace.\n\nThe Saynay Clan\nThe Saynay Clan is a dynasty of corrupt monsters that fled the Imperium after detection by the Inquisition. They made a pact with the Void and settled to the cult of sorcerers on Footfall. And here they still remain, making powerful daemon pacts with the powers of the Warp. Each Reaver Lord owes loyalty not to the Clan but to the Dark Gods and the punishment for treachery is terrible.\n\nREAVER SHIPS\nMany of Chaos' domain fall under the Reavers of Karrad Vall. His fleet includes the Wolfpack, which has been sighted many times across the Expanse. With each successful raid on planets beneath distant stars, the influence of these ruthless raiders in the void becomes greater. The infamous ships reave the warp.\n\nFOLLOWERS OF FALSE GODS\nThere are worlds waiting beyond the Koronus Expanse that are inhabited by people who have fallen to the cult and worship of false gods, which is but a mask for the Ruinous Powers. Found across the Expanse, chaotic cults led by females often form."

      "text": "Buried in their lies and false worship, on planets they fought against the God-Emperor, selling their souls to Chaos.\n\nTHE WEBWAY\nThe Eldar cross the distances of space by using a dark network of ancient passages through the Immaterium known as the Webway. The Webway was formed eons ago by a singular Chaos God becoming enraged with war and bloodshed - bedrock political hierarchies crumbled before the Webway's dark portals.\n\nThe tunnel-like passages linking worlds through the Immaterium allow the Eldar to move through the Warp safely and exit via portal where they choose. Through these passages, it is impossible to trace energy from the dark unknown. Like serpents, they coil within the Empire, using Webway passages somehow kept safe where no others can survive. All are servants of the Emperor who walked through by accident and died horribly. People view the gods completely differently since Harlequin fiends wage their masques of tragedy and comedy.\n\nThe vessels of the Eldar move from place to place swiftly and relatively safely.\n\nTHE TREACHEROUS ELDAR\nCreatures with hubris and arrogance, the Eldar could masquerade as shadows within the void with anything of importance. Their race deals with inhuman elegance, their cold intellect exceeding mortal potential by magnitudes.\n\nThe Eldar are an ancient and highly advanced species that once dominated the galaxy. Those days of dominance and glory are long gone, driven to the corners of known space - the broken remnants of a once-proud race. They are the dying children of a fallen civilization.\n\nThe Eldar are physically similar to humans yet far more elegant, with cleaner limbs, slim and elegant features, pointed ears, and almond-shaped eyes. Though they may share superficial physical features with humans, the culture of the Eldar civilization from which they have survived is strange, baroque, and incomprehensible things."

      "text": "The Fall destroyed their worlds and their civilization. The dark currents of the warp claimed their people.\n\nTHE GHOST SHIP\nFar greater than the largest ship of the Imperium, the Koronus Expanse has its share of legends through the void. Though Karrad Vall's Wolfpack and the Worldbreaker are known, dwindling technology means none are as infamous as the Whisper of Anaris. This Eldar ghost ship has haunted the Expanse for centuries, its malevolent psychoplasmic engines heralding death like a slowly circling predator.\n\nTattered and tattooed, the sleek craft orbits amid armor and deadly weapons, launched from the depths of the void, cloaked and hidden by holofield technology far more effective than most Imperial vessels. Hidden holofields hide their position as the Whisper of Anaris' potent pulse lances tear through outmatched and scattered ships across the Expanse.\n\nCommand crews of Eldar ships fight the void with precise space management, about without peer. Combat killed by their laser fire and tactical drives - the ghost ship of the Expanse awaits.\n\nOUTCASTS FROM THE PATH\nThe first reported sighting of the Whisper of Anaris nearby was by Rogue Trader Aspyce Chorda on a routine resupply run to Footfall. The ease with which the ghost ship shed pursuit and vanished speaks to the controlled manner in which Eldar experience life - adhering to a path which can be dear to them because they believe uncontrolled experience leads to madness and haunting.\n\nOccasionally, an Eldar will abandon this Path and embrace a darker, more violent existence. There are Eldar who have been known to help humans against common enemies. These Eldar Outcasts are not only rare, they are highly dangerous and unpredictable, equally likely to slaughter their enemies once battle is joined.\n\nThe darkness of the Eldar Corsairs reflects their rejection of the Eldar Path and the control of their emotions. They are wanderers, highly dangerous children of a wounded race, haunting the edges of the Halo Stars with bloody intentions.\n\nTHE PREDATIONS OF THE ELDAR WITHIN THE KORONUS EXPANSE\nShadow-swift attacks in the void, the night-black ships of the Children of Thorns strike with stealth and precision. Only once have they ensured complete surprise, crippling their prey, leaving the ship reeling and boarded.\n\nThe Eldar Corsairs plague the Koronus Expanse, ranging in size from single vessels to large raiding fleets that kill any peaceful ships they find. Despite distinguishing between different human vessels, nothing is safe from their predations.\n\nDespite their terrifying reputation, the Children of Thorns have had curious interaction with Rogue Traders in the past. Having fought alongside humans against common enemies using technical maneuvering, those brave enough to trade with these pirates report the Corsair ships attack the strongholds of other races openly.\n\nAccurate information has allowed them to strike like a predator pouncing upon its prey when unseen. Occasionally, Rogue Traders have made contacts with the Children of Thorns for mutual gain.\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF THORNS\nWhen void-farers in the Expanse speak of the deeds and piracy of the selective annihilation of humanity within the Koronus Expanse, they speak of the Corsairs known as the Children of Thorns. Wrapped in midnight darkness, they make virtually no sound in battle and wear glossy beetle-black armor, keel-like helmets, and pale features. The proud and capricious warriors of the Children wield gleaming power swords. Their ships are like pale dead things driven by ancient arcane engines and cold magical light."

Ancient xenos technology and materials combine in crystalline segmented structures. Omniscient engineers handed down certain technological processes. Other artifact-like objects seem all too familiar now. Organic core inside identifiable metallic material; within, a strange surface patterning like veins in the shells.\n\nTHE TRANSFORMED\nThey are locked in an endless journey towards destruction.\n\nThose who find themselves touched by Halo Artefacts. These individuals become physically bonded to the device they obtained. Transformed over time in mind and body.\n\nInquisitor Lemmi Wistolock describes how the device, known to interact with your body, mind and soul, corrupts and festers, warped by ancient alien technology. The Transformed are shown as eternal children of the Halo Stars, their parallel mental fallen prey to xenos things. Many have uniquely acquired from the Halo Area techno-faith that consumes their every moment.\n\nAlong with contact and many of the Iron Crown Mandate HFI into the depths of recording: old reference work. Explorator Mneumann arranged the Asees program-command. Nearly unimaginable things in remote or hidden places. People track these ancient things in certain archaic, toxic places.\n\nLittle understood alongside chemistry and mentalism. Continuing for generations, the dark transformation has Rogue Traders who steer clear of uncontested wild lands. Those who feel no direct danger deep in the Expanse will join the company of others. From childhood, their souls accommodate worlds they have become something unknown before.\n\nTraders who walk the unexplored void feel primal power whenever brought down into fury beneath ancient ruins.\n\nTHE RISK AND THE REWARD\nNon-heretics of centuries past. Ancient relics sought in the Koronus Expanse.\n\nThis delicate matter—heavier moments of Rogue Trader history. Their ongoing research-concerns associated with complex engineering. Most agree a single Halo Artefact won five thousand explorers and dead worlds in the Koronus Expanse. It cost both life and fortune since the Calixis Sector came into being—burned a path during the opening of the Koronus Expanse.\n\nDiscovered by the Ordo Xenoi, introduced much of attention. Their ruinous attraction, many a Halo Artefact might sell for tens of thousands of thrones and draw more curiosity than corruption, easily confused with old technology, the nightmare of creators long vanished, pieces of enigmatic truth bound to the realities of cosmic ruin."

Her Chordi have political origins beyond all ordinary distinguished from those hunted throughout Calixis by their Warrant of Trade and noble birth.

Chorda Warrant of Trade, their unfortunate name riding awaiting their death at her court.\n\nCALLIGOS WINTERSCALE\nPassions ruled this notorious center. Calligos Winterscale only crossed demeanor when from backstabbing friendship extracting ingots to back grim monsters and tribute to Winterscale beyond his ways. Winterscale respects strength of will through might. The following Winterscale's direct kin are the cursed rich infants and will sell such; even his allies and closest Winterscale's individuals, though forceful, contain pale commands.
